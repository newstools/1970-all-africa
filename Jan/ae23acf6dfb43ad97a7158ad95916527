Dodoma &mdash; The Minister of State in the President's Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr George Simbachawene, has requested Parliament to approve Sh6.58 trillion for the Teachers' Commission, 26 regions and 185 local councils.Out of the sum, Sh1.78 trillion will finance development projects, while Sh4.08 trillion will be for the recurrent expenditure. Last year, Parliament approved Sh6.02 trillion for the ministry with Sh1.6 trillion being for development projects.However, up to February this year the ministry had received Sh3.56 trillion equivalent to 59 per cent of the approved budget, according to Mr Simbachawene.

Reports show that these ghost workers were causing the government a loss of Sh25.4 billion on a monthly basis."We have managed to recover Sh2.7 billion of that amount and there are efforts to make sure the remaining amount is repaid and take serious measures against individuals, who were involved in such losses," he said as he tabled the 2017/18 budget for his docket.He went on to explain that 541 ghost workers were found in the regional secretariat, while 12,828 of them were in the local government.Mr Simbachawene also said the government had taken disciplinary measures against 102 public servants, including terminating their jobs, issuing them with warnings, demoting, reducing their salaries, suing and asking them to repay money lost in their jobs.Conflict solvingMr Simbachawene told the House that the government had formed a team to solve the conflicts between villages, districts, regions and that of farmers and pastoralists to address land conflicts.He said the team was working in collaboration with the ministries of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development; PO-Ralg; Natural Resources and Tourism; Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; and that of Water and Irrigation."Already the team has submitted its report which is being reviewed by permanent secretaries," he said.Special groupsThe government had identified 346,889 elderly people and 74,590 were given identities to enable them access free health service as required by the policy.
