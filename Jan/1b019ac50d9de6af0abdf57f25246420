It also calls for stronger collaboration and engagement among all stakeholders behind the goal of achieving UHC, while leaving no one behind,&rdquo; stated Dr Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.Discussions at the event have acknowledged the progress in health made over the past years but also recognised the need to address &lsquo;old enemies&rsquo; such as HIV, TB and malaria and the new threats presented by non-communicable diseases and&nbsp; climate change.
