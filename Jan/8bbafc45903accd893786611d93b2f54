Ibadan &mdash; The Senator repreasenting Osun West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Sen. Isiaka Adeleke has advised Nigerians and governments at different levels to embrace local tourism to boost the economy of the country.Senator Adeleke who said tourism is a viable sector through which the economy of the country can be revived, charged every individual to encourage domestic tourism instead of expending huge resources on foreign ones.He explained that tourism has huge potentials which have not been fully utilized, noting that some countries in the world have sustained their economies through their investment in the tourism sector which has yielded fruitful results.The Chairman, Senate Committee on Capital Market, during a visit to Tinapa Resort in Calabar pointed out that there are so many tourist sites within the country which were not being utilized, stating that the said tourist centres just lay fallow in their various locations. According to Senator Adeleke, "it is good that we are diversifying our economy to meet the various challenges we are facing as a country. One of the key sectors we should not neglect is tourism. It is a viable sector if properly tapped and harnessed."Some African countries rely on their tourism potentials to boost their economy. People throughout the world spend huge sums of money on tourism because tourism is part of our day to day activities. If we encourage local tourism, it will help with the development of our local content. I believe the federal government and some state governments are already working assiduously to tap into the huge tourism potentials."However, I will like to charge them to make our tourist sites more attractive. Tourism is money-spinning and Nigeria should not be left out of the opportunity it provides. Nigerians should also patronize our tourist sites instead of expending on foreign ones," Adeleke emphasized.
