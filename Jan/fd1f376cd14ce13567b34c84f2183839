Mabel, the wife of popular comedian, Ayo Makun, aka AY, has asked a popular Lagos socialite, Freda Francis, to steer clear of her husband.Trouble began after the mother of one commented on a post shared by her husband.The photo, which was a selfie taken by AY and Freda Francis at the socialite's Push Party in Lagos on Sunday night, attracted many comments.Mabel wrote, "This is outright wickedness and I won't take it! I think have had enough of the ridiculing. Freda Francis, stay away from my family and I mean it!"She went to her page and posted munched chats between her husband and Freda.Her post has however sent Instagram into frenzy.Although Mabel has since taken the post down, it appears to have cast worries in the minds of her friends and well-wishers.Freda, who is best known as singer, Iyanya's ex-girlfriend, was Mabel's friend. She is currently heavy.However, AY is yet to pull down the photo 13 hours after he posted.When PREMIUM TIMES put a call across to AY, he said, "How is my marriage your business?" and then he dropped the call.This is second time that AY's marriage will be trailed by controversy. In February 2016, it was reported that Mabel had moved out of their Lekki home for undisclosed reasons. The couple that wedded in 2008 however denied the rumours in a joint statement.
