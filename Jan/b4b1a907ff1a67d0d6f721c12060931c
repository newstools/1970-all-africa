Gusau &mdash; Residents of Zamfara State have been scrambling for vaccination following the outbreak of meningitis in the state. Daily Trust observed a large number of residents lined up for the vaccination at the designated centres.An adult who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Trust that the outbreak instilled panic in the minds of the residents because of the number of deaths recorded."I was told that the vaccination is for people from 1 to 29 years old. I will clock 40 years this year but I went for the vaccination because I can't afford to miss it. I asked my wife to as a matter of urgency take our four kids to the vaccination centres," he said.Another resident, Rashida Zubairu said fear gripped her after one of her neighbour's daughters died from the disease."My husband instructed me to take our children to the center for the vaccination. I arrived here about 30 minutes ago and I won't go home until we are all vaccinated," she added.Daily Trust findings revealed that the residents were panicking because of the fast spread of the epidemic to towns and villages in the state.Meanwhile, about 346 people have died while 3,145 have been infected since the outbreak of meningitis in the state, Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Abdullahi Muhammad Shinkafi revealed.Shinkafi who is also the chairman of the state's Committee on Monitoring, Prevention, Control and Sensitization said about 279,000 residents were vaccinated with Gora ward having 19,874 vaccinated residents.A few weeks ago, the death recorded was 215 and infected persons was 1,800.Shinkafi explained that 379 types of medicinal items were purchased and disbursed to all designated centres across the state adding that his committee has so far spent N21 million on the medicines. He called on residents not to panic as the war against the scourge was being won."Nineteen wards out 147 wards in the state have received vaccination. The vaccines are coming and we are determined to make it reach every nook and cranny of the state. All the 14 local governments were given N6m each as part of the quick response strategy. This is apart from N52m given to our committee," he said.He advised residents to immediately report any side effects they have after the vaccination to the nearest medical facility to them, adding that about 2,000 health personnel have been deployed to the health centres.The state Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Sulaiman Gummi warned relatives of infected persons receiving treatment in the hospitals to desist from coming in to direct contact with victims as the disease is contagious.He urged the residents not to hesitate in rushing to the hospital on seeing any symptoms, adding that timely admission and treatment of the patients would help a lot in saving lives.An assessment carried out by Save the Children, an international non-governmental organization has revealed that 97% of meningitis victims in Zamfara State were women.The Area Operations Manager (AOM) of the organization in the state, Mr. Kennedy Yibin disclosed this at a one day stakeholders round table on women and girls empowerment and health outcomes and indices in the state.Mr. Yibin said the organization came about the percentage after going round many of the meningitis isolation centres set up by the state government at various health facilities.He attributed the development to poverty, illiteracy and poor accessibility to healthcare services.He said that if there was change of attitude at the family level which he described as the "baseline" and without any cost, the woman would realize her potentials and how to take better care of her family particularly her children.Yibin explained that the meningitis scourge would not have ravaged the state like it did if women were empowered and their potentials developed to an appreciable level.
