This is up 9% from R2.5bn reported in the previous period. ROE was down to 19.9%, from 20.5% reported in 2015. The group views WesBank's performance as "pleasing", "particularly in its domestic businesses, which are operating in an environment characterised by constrained consumer disposable income and a challenging credit cycle."The group expects economic growth to pick up in 2017, however it may not be enough to provide "significant support" to revenue growth."In addition, global and domestic political risks continue to pose downside risk to this expectation," the group said. However the group is optimistic that it will continue to deliver growth in earnings with an ROE targeted between 18% and 22%.FirstRand's shares were trading 0.37% lower at R51.05 at 10:00 in Johannesburg.Source: Fin24
