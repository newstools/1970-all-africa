The urge of writing has evolved right from the Stone Age to the present Space Age for purposes of keeping permanent records of communication.The colonisation of Africa and later the coming of missionaries contributed much to authorship in Uganda. The establishment of the Government Printer by the colonial government in 1902 created the first signs of government's commitment to authorship.The 1960s ushered in the development of educational authorship, with the coming up of publishing firms mostly from Britain and based in Nairobi, Kenya. Indeed, academic authorship shaped knowledge development, contributed to theory building, facilitated information sharing and enhanced practice. It has been a major vehicle for national socio-economic development.After the declaration of economic war by President Idi Amin in 1972, most of these publishing firms closed, leading to the establishment of the National Curriculum Development Centre in 1973.When the National Resistance Movement took power in 1986, government liberalized the economy, privatised government business and came up with a national textbook policy in 1998 that saw the emergence of a local publishing industry. The result was phenomenal; the number of textbook publishers increased to over 27.There was a remarkable increase in local authorship of textbooks, especially at primary and secondary school levels. There was an attempt to raise the profile of authors up to 2007, when civil society was actively participating in the book sector development programmes.For example, the National Book Trust of Uganda, (Nabotu), formed in 1997, carried out a number of activities in promoting library development and reading culture in the country.With support from the Norwegian Non-fiction and Translators Association (NFF), Nabotu conducted a study on the strategic interventions to address the needs of academic authorship in Uganda that resulted in the formation of Uganda Textbook-Academic and Non-Fiction Authors Association (Utana). A 2014 survey of four bookshops in Kampala by Utana indicated that more than 250 titles of academic and non-fiction books authored by Ugandans are in the marketplace.Despite the existing legal environment of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act, 2006, authorship in Uganda has continued to experience challenges, including lack of adequate financial reward for authors. There is uncontrolled piracy, which has denied copyright owners revenue.Consequently, there is no direct monetary gain from authorship, partly because of a poor reading culture in Uganda and, therefore, limited size of the book market. To make matters worse, there is lack of funding opportunities (including by government) for writers to invest in authorship.The only funding capacity in Uganda is apparently witnessed in universities and research institutions, but most of them target academic research outputs.This could be changed by integrating writing programmes in society right from primary school to national level by the education and gender ministries. An author's popularity and exposure is exhibited when the work is used because it adds to the visibility of the author and the institutions.Since 2012, Utana has endeavoured to bring together authors and writers to build their capacity on issues pertaining to authorship, such as issues of copyright, earning a living in authorship, technical skills and competence in authorship, authorship mentorship, author- publisher partnerships, and book design and marketing.In Uganda, there are many authors who have manuscripts but cannot be published by the commercial publishers, after complaints that they get short-changed. Others get frustrated and end up throwing away manuscripts while others opt to sell their rights at giveaway prices.Uganda is endowed with experienced and knowledgeable people with untapped potential to write books full of insights that could benefit the country. Some have ideas in their heads but cannot write them down, due to lack of financial capacity or lack of know-how.For instance, a retired head teacher could write a book on how to avoid or diffuse a strike, a successful farmer could share his experience on profitable farming, and a successful cattle keeper could share on keeping a healthy herd.To tap such potential requires support for research and to build capacity of such knowledgeable people to put down their experience and insights for society's benefits. Whereas the publishing industry in Uganda has been developing over time, its market targets books based on schools' curricula, and most of the knowledge outside the syllabus remains undocumented and unpublished.Writing is good for the economy; it's one way of fighting poverty and unemployment, and motivating creativity. With the blossoming of authorship, many printers would find jobs to feed their families, bookshops would multiply and create jobs for book sellers as authors find money to put food on the table for their families and send their children to schools where teachers will work.Teachers would buy food from farmers whose produce would rot in the fields without customers. Publishers would also smile all the way to the bank and support the Uganda Revenue Authority.It is high time government considered supporting writers and authors' programs for getting published to meet the competitive global market.Utana is holding a writers/authors' dinner on June 23, 2017 to share on a strategy to tap the gold that the authors represent for a transformed Uganda.The author is chairman of Uganda Textbook- Academic and Non-Fiction Authors Association, and a professor of Information Science at Makerere University
