Following Uganda Communications Commission's notice, NBS Television is reviewing its signature and popular Tuesday morning show, 'One on One with Tamale Mirundi'NBS says the review is to ensure that the show is operated within guidelines as stipulated by Uganda Communications Commission's (UCC). This week, UCC issued a 60-day notice to suspend NBS TV's broadcasting license for breaching minimum broadcasting standards.The notice dated May 11, makes reference to NBS programme featuring presidential advisor, Joseph Tamale Mirundi. In the letter, UCC executive director Godfrey Mutabazi says that the commission is appalled and takes strong exception to the conduct and language used by Mirundi while on air.The notice followed the Tuesday, May 9, in which Mirundi lost his cool while on air and attempted to get physical with the programme host Simon Muyanga Lutaaya, after he questioned him about copies of his purported lease application, seen earlier circulating on social media yet he is one of the critics of the lease promotion campaign.On the programme, Mirundi angrily attacked Buganda Land Board (BLB) officials as well as kingdom officials over the ongoing campaign dubbed 'Ekyaapa mu Ngalo'.The campaign which is running for the next six months is aimed at strengthening security of tenure for tenants on the kingdom land. The kingdom is using the drive to issue leasehold certificates of title to tenants on Kabaka's land.Mirundi denied ever applying for leasehold under the new campaign, claiming the documents leaked by BLB officials to say that he, himself applied for leasehold were very old - dating 10 years back.UCC observed that the abusive language used by Mirundi on the programme contravened public morality and promoted a culture of violence and ethnic prejudice.Kin Karisa, the chief executive officer of NBS says that they have undertaken an internal review of the programme and are now waiting to discuss it with UCC for advice on how to make it better while operating within minimum broadcasting standards.Karisa says that the management of NBS TV is equally concerned over the strong language used by Mirundi. He reiterates that UCC has not stopped NBS TV from hosting Mirundi but only challenged the media house to ensure that the programme meets the basic minimum broadcasting standards.UCC's director for corporate affairs Fred Otunnu says that the notice issued to NBS TV is not about the personality but the content of the program. He adds that every licensee should be able to manage the person hosted."What if you stop that programme and then such content contrary to minimum broadcasting standards are aired again? Tamale Mirundi is not barred, but he should be controlled by the licensee" Otunnu stated.Section 41, of the UCC Act empowers the commission to give any operator written notice of not less than 60 days in case of an impending suspension or revocation of a broadcasting license. During the period, the operator may make representations to the commission to stop the action.
