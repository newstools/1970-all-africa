ORGANISERS for the inaugural Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) have called for submissions of nominees for the first event to be held later in the year.The awards which were established this year are meant to honour artists from Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and South.There has been a general feeling from artists in the region that they are not fairly represented in national awards, hence the need to come up with the BAA.Nominations are set to close on May 15 and the final list of nominees will be announced by June 7 with the main event slated for June 30 at the Large City Hall.The awards are running under the theme, "Celebrating arts excellence".In an interview, the spokesperson, Nkulukelo Nkala, said the response they have received from artists, the corporate sector and the public has been heart-warming."The response that we have received so far is far more than we expected. Many bought into the idea judging from the number of entries and nominations we have received so far."The business community has pledged to support the awards and our local authority also gave the venue to host the ceremony," said Nkala.He said the awards are meant help improve the standard of the arts in the region."The awards are not an act of rebellion but a drive to reward local art and to push for higher quality works. It also means that more local acts will be catered for and will have a chance to be recognised," he added.He said there will greater public participation as each vote will carry a 25 percent public vote.A total of 38 awards will be given out on the night under the following categories: Special Awards, DJ Awards, Music Awards, Visual Arts Awards, Dance Awards, Theatre Awards, Spoken Word Awards, Fashion and Lifestyle Awards, Film Awards and Art in Schools Awards.
