The federal government is spending N450 daily (N150 per meal) in feeding each of the over 50, 000 inmates in detention across the 227 Nigeria Prison Service facilities in the country.For graduates doing their one-year compulsory National Youths Service Corp (NYSC), the federal government is spending N500 daily, per head, in providing three-square meals.The feeding budget for cadets at the Police Training College, Ikeja, Lagos is N2000 daily, per head. A police official said N500 is spent per meal, while the remaining N500 is for "feeding logistics."The feeding mode is nearly the same in the states for governors, legislators and schools. In Katsina state, for instance, the state government is spending about N30 per meal on every boarding student in the state.Official data shows that the state government is spending N100 daily per student for the three-square meals in the state.On the other hand, the Katsina state governor and his deputy spend an average of N650, 000 daily on food and catering services.Details of the state 2017 budget show that N243 million has been budgeted for food and catering services by the Katsina State Government House.

"I have to see what the federal government is putting at the table of the students with N50 per meal to actually know the nutritious value of the meal," she said.The dietician however added that "even though I don't want to make a sweeping statement, but it will take some magic by states or federal government to provide a nutritious meal the students required for their development."&lrm;Allowance be reviewed to N1000 - CSOThe Policy Adviser of a Civil Society Action Coalition on Education (CSACEFA), Chioma Osuji, said the feeding allowance was too small considering the current economic situation of the country.She said the feeding allowances should be reviewed to N1000 per day per student. "Looking at the reality on ground N200 is not enough," adding that N200 could not feed a child three square meal. She said the students could not concentrate because of hunger.Ms Osuji called on government to increase the feeding allowance. She urged government to constitute a monitoring team that would monitor the food given to students.What should be done - &lrm;Old boysThe best way to solve this challenge is for government to cap the admission and quota of the unity schools, the president of Unity Schools &lrm;Old Students Association (USOSA), Professor Chidi Odinkalu said.Speaking to Daily Trust by telephone, Odinkalu said over population, abuse of admission processes and poor administration of the schools are responsible for the predicament."Unity schools are grossly over-populated, facilities are inadequate. The administration of the schools are bastardised by local officials in collaboration with federal officials," he said."For instance, the problem in Queens College Lagos can't be solved without capping the admission intake. The school is originally established for 95 students. But now it has students population of 3800&lrm;," he said.He said the value of the money budgeted for meals for the students has been rubbished by inflation and poor purchasing power in the last three years.He said the federal government has to reduce the admission intake for it to plan and manage the schools better. He said some of the schools are worse than prisons.Nuruddeen M. Abdallah, Misbahu Bashir &amp; Maureen Onochie, Habibu Aminu and Eugene Agh
