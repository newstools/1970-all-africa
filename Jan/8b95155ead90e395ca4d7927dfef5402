Seventeen deejays turned up on Sunday for the finale of this year's Club DJ awards at Lido beach Entebbe.The event was also celebrating 10 years of existence, having been started by Trance Events in 2008. While it was billed as a showcase for deejays from allover the country, only the Central region was represented with competitors coming from Ntinda, Kampala and Entebbe.Preliminary sessions had been held in Mbarara and Mbale for western and eastern region deejays, respectively. Even the regional winners DJ Genious (East) and DJ Byarugaba were a no-show.DJ Tony, the brains behind the event, was not available to comment on the matter, as his known number could not be reached. However, to last year's winner from the Eastern region and finalist, DJ Inno, the lack of communication and facilitation from organizers was a big hindrance."Many upcountry DJs are not even aware they have to attend the finale in Kampala," he told The Observer.That left the awards open to only performers based in Kampala. The 17 deejays were cut to nine after the first session. The DJs had to showcase their skills on the decks in two minutes.This could have overwhelmed some who tried to mix all the songs on their playlist, which proved hard. There was some level of versatility and some competitors such as Obzeera DJ went as far sampling Freda Sonko's Olupapula Ssi Mupiira.The only female, DJ Kathy, was eliminated in the first round; not because she could not play, but what looked like stage fright. She struggled with equipment even after a successful sound test and the unforgiving crowd sent her packing.By 11pm, DJ Isaac, who also plays at Lido beach, had been declared winner, taking home Shs 2m. NBS TV's MC Percy hosted the event.
