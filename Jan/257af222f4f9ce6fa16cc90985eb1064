The House yeast strain, cultivated by Angostura&reg; since the 1930's in Trinidad, combined with the addition of other spices and neutral alcohol from its distillery, result in an elevation of a classic liqueur creating an entirely new-world dimension to the category. Like Angostura&reg; aromatic bitters, the Amaro di Angostura&reg; recipe is a secret. Bottled at 35% ABV, Amaro di Angostura&reg; is a deep amber colour, offering aromas of cinnamon, dark chocolate and unmistakable Angostura&reg; aromatic bitters. The flavours explode on the tongue with warm cinnamon and liquorice notes. The finish is perfectly balanced, exotic, lush and reminiscent of the essence of Trinidad and Tobago's pulsating rhythms, tropical climate and beauty. Amaro di Angostura&reg; can be enjoyed over ice, is splendid on its own and offers delicious harmony in a cocktail.A Range of 6 Distinctive RumsAngostura's international range of rums includes five distinctive, exquisitely blended rums produced exclusively at The House of Angostura in Trinidad: Angostura&reg; 1787, Angostura 1824&reg;, Angostura 1919&reg;, Angostura&reg; 7 Year Old, Angostura&reg; 5 Year Old and Angostura&reg; ReservaAngostura&reg; 1787: Angostura&reg; 1787 Rum is a super-premium blend of rums aged for a minimum of 15 years.

The journey started in 1824 when founder Dr. Johann Siegert first produced aromatic bitters in Angostura, Venezuela (today called Ciudad Bolivar). In the 1870's, Dr. Siegert's three sons migrated to Trinidad, among them Don Carlos Siegert, who pioneered the brand, establishing Angostura&reg; aromatic bitters as an integral ingredient in premium cocktails and ultimately a mainstay of cocktail culture. The family's Siegert Bouquet Rum became a Trinidadian tradition up until the early 1960's and part of the company's rich rum heritage. In the 1970's, The House of Angostura&reg; expanded, acquiring the Fernandes family distillery, which was founded in the 1890's by Manoel Fernandes, an immigrant from Portugal, and known for making high quality rums.Angostura&reg; Rums: The True Spirit of TrinidadAngostura's&reg; rums could only be created in Trinidad, a country that is home to adventurous peoples from almost every corner of the world. Today that adventurous spirit is manifest in Trinidad's music, food, art, and (of course!) in our creative ability to make exquisite rums. The House of Angostura&reg; has captured the true spirit of Trinidad and Tobago for more than 190 years! According to Angostura&reg; Master Distiller John Georges: "Our rums are 100% Trinidadian, made in one distillery, on one Island."Available World WideThe House of Angostura exports 100% of its production to almost every country in the world.
