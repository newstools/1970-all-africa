Dodoma &mdash; The Parliamentary Committee on Lands, Natural Resources and Tourism yesterday called on the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) to assess the impact of VAT on the sector of tourism.The government introduced VAT for all tourism services effective from July 1. The move has since put the government and service providers at loggerheads.Committee chairman Atashasta Nditiye (Muhambwe-CCM) told the House that tourism stakeholders (hoteliers, transporters and tour guides) had been complaining that the VAT had badly affected their businesses by reducing the number of tourists and increasing the cost of doing business.The committee noted that, the ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism on several occasions had been reporting that VAT inclusion had not in any way affected the sector apart from significantly boosting government revenue."Since the committee could not ascertain the truth of the matter on the effects of VAT in the tourism sector and since the impasse between tourism stakeholders and the government could derail the development of this key sector, it is important for this House to debate this matter and if possible the CAG should probe it and advise the government on the best way forward," advised Mr Nditiye.The committee also advised the government to establish a marketing and advertising budget to enable the Tanzania Tourist Board advertise tourist attractions in and outside the country. The committee noted that the current advertising budget was very small compared to that of the competitors, especially South Africa and Kenya. Earlier, the minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Prof Jumanne Maghembe, presented Sh148 billion budget estimates for his ministry for 2017/18. He said Sh96.7 billion would be for recurrent expenditure and Sh51.8 billion for development projects.Prof Maghembe told the House that the sector of tourism continued to grow in 2016/17. "Tourism generated $2 billion in 2016 compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. A total of 1,284,279 tourists visited Tanzania in 2016 compared to 1,137,182 tourists in 2015," he noted.The minister also noted that 500,000 people were directly employed in the sector of tourism in 2016/17, while self-employment reached one million as the sector generated 17.5 per cent of GDP and 25 per cent of foreign exchange.He said the government would compensate all legally licensed traders affected by the government's three-year ban on exports of live animals instituted in May 2016.
