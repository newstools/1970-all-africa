President Robert Mugabe has arrived in New York for a summit on oceans, the state media reports.As Zimbabwe is a landlocked country, the news of Mugabe's latest trip has been greeted with shock and ridicule particularly coming soon after his return from Mexico where he attended a conference on disaster reduction."The UN should only invite relevant guests to these conferences," said lawyer and activist, Fadzayi Mahere on Twitter.According to the ZBC, "The conference in New York will be co-hosted by the governments of Fiji and Sweden at the United Nations headquarters in New York, from Monday to the 9th of this month."Added ZBC: "The theme of the conference is, 'Our Oceans Our Future: Partnering for the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal no. 14".Mexican Feelings ...
