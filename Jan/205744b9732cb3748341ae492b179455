NEWLY-elected Confederation of African Football (CAF) President, Ahmad Ahmad, will make his first regional visit when he officially attends the Council of Southern African Football Associations (COSAFA) meeting on Friday. He will co-chair the meeting with COSAFA President, Phillip Chiyangwa, in Johannesburg on Friday. Delegates will arrive on Thursday. This is the Madagascan's first high-profile engagement following his defeat of Issa Hayatou, by 34-20, in elections that took place in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa last month. Former Zimbabwean legislator is hailed as the mastermind behind Hayatou's defeat. All of COSAFA's 14 Football Association Presidents, from Angola, Botswana, Comoros Islands, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe will attend. Chiyangwa said there was no particular agenda for the meeting. "It is just for all of COSAFA FA Presidents to meet and greet our new CAF President.," said Chiyangwa. He said most members might have wanted to have a one-on-one meeting with the CAF President but COSAFA decided to bring everyone together to talk Ahmad. "Ahmad hails from the COSAFA Region and I think it is proper that the FA Presidents come and greet one of their own," added Chiyangwa. - CAJ News
