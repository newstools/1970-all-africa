By the time the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway is completed, a number of Ugandan workers will have sufficient skills to grow their careers after China Communications Construction Company, the contractors of the road, said they remain committed to transferring skills to its local staff.Recently, CCCC held a two-day welding skills contest, where they equipped 11 welders with artisan skills. The contest held recently was in commemoration of the International Labour day.In a company statement, Joseph Zheng Biao, the acting country manager of CCCC, said the contest was organized for their local employees who will need the skills to growth their careers."All the contestants are local employees from our repair workshop and welding workgroup. We wanted our employees to master their welding skills," said Zheng Biao.The welding contest came at a time when Uganda's government is aggressively pushing for the need for skills transfer and the use of local content. In the oil and gas sector, there have been calls for foreign companies to have succession plans, where Ugandan workers will have to take over top positions in these companies after a certain period.The workers at CCCC gained skills in gas-cutting and electric welding. The panel of judges, consisting of Chinese professional welders, rated the performance of the welders through their comprehensiveness in the welding process.Gabriel Omiat emerged winner of the contest. The best three were awarded with certificates of merit on top of Shs 300,000, Shs 200,000 and Shs 100,000 respectively.Biao said: "We shall continue using this platform as a learning experience and a way of motivating our staff to even do better. We are creating an atmosphere in which people will study while working and also be able to practice what they study to improve on their skills. We hope to have this contest every year."The Kampala-Entebbe Expressway is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.
