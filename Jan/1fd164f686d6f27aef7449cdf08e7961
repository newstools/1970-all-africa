The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has launched a five-year strategic plan bringing together civil society organisations (CSOs) and rival professions for the first time in attempts to improve the health sector.NMA met yesterday in Abuja with development partners, CSOs, professional associations and organised private sector to finalise the plan 2017-2022.The association president, Dr Mike Ogirima, said, "We will walk the talk to reach even the hardest-to-reach areas with the key interventions of public health education, personal and environmental hygiene, medically supervised [antenatal] services, routine as well as other immunisation campaigns and other infant/child survival programmes.""The health sector for now is in shambles and every effort is being made through CSOs and our partners to make sure the health sector is what it is supposed to be," Dr Kingsley Enweremadu, vice president of NMA said.The plan is structured after the National Strategic Health Development Plan, developed by the federal health ministry in 2009, which has ended and was up for review. But it includes areas of health care, where doctors can play direct roles, including operationalising the National Health Act, clinical governance, medical education and research, and improving health care delivery nationwide."You see alignment, combining of its members with contributing to the health sector and meeting health sector broad goals," explained Dr Nkata Chuku, founding partner of Health Systems Consult, who worked on a team that developed both the NHA and the NMA Plan."NMA has realised we can't go it alone. We need to reach out to all the other professional organisations. The health sector will only really move forward when all the professional groups within the health sector come together as one. Fragment, it is easier to pick us off one by one or create divisions within the group.""The only way we can do it is all stakeholders bring their skill and competencies. At the end of the day, we are all producers and consumers of health," said Dr Ben Anyene, chair on the board of the Health Reform Foundation of Nigeria, which helped push for the National Health Act."NMA is trying to provide this platform so that all of us can come to the table openly, transparently and accountably doing our own, if you know what your responsibilities are. At the end of the day, the result we want to see is that we are doing better in health, and own it. Borrowing to finance our healthcare is not sustainable," Anyene said.
