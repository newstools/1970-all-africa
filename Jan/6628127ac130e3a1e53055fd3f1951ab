The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) on Monday informed members of the public that it has provided passport booklets to all its Passport Issuing Centres across the country.The NIS, in a statement that was signed by its Public Relations Officer, James Sunday, said the attention of its Comptroller General, Muhammad Babandede, was drawn to some media reports of persisting scarcity of Passports Booklets across its Passport Issuing Centre.But the statement stressed that "there is no scarcity of passport booklets across all our Issuing Centres in Nigeria and abroad."The NIS had in March informed members of the public about a shortfall in the supply of Passport Booklets in its system."The situation has since been resolved following government's intervention and normalcy has been restored in all the Issuing Centres as contained in our notices to the public. The Comptroller General is by the notice encouraging all deserving passport applicants to approach the nearest passport offices to them directly to process their Passports and avoid patronising touts who may make the process difficult for them."They may also wish to forward all complaints/challenges on the process to immigrationspro@gmail.com for attention. The public is hereby advised to disregard the misinformation about scarcity of passport booklets and always contact the service for all our services," it added.
