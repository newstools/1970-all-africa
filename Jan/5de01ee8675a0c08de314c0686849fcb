Johannesburg &mdash; WALKING a distance of 1 459 kilometers is one of the craziest adventures ever imaginable. It is no child's play either. But that is exactly what proponents of mental health will soon embark on when they walk from Pretoria to Cape Town to raise awareness of mental illness in South Africa. "Many people think that it's crazy to walk from Pretoria to Cape Town," says Francois Louw, Chief Executive Officer of Vista Clinic. It is one of 30 psychiatric hospitals in the National Health Network (NHN) group of hospitals and the principal sponsor of the initiative. Louw conceded there are far easier ways of travelling between the two capitals, which makes the walk appear crazy. He highlights the primary objective of this initiative is to elevate awareness of mental illness. "More importantly though, it aims to de-stigmatize the associations around the word 'crazy', often used through ignorance and fear of mental illness." The walk will start in Pretoria on September 4 and conclude in Cape Town October 10 to coincide with World Mental Health Day. "We're encouraging all South Africans to do something a little crazy on October10 in celebration of World Mental Health Day and in solidarity with people suffering with mental illness and so, we are naming the day,National Crazy Socks Day." As the walk progresses through the towns along the route, public talks are planned to educate communities around mental illness, with a specific focus on depression, anxiety and mood disorders. A focal point of this initiative is also to promote mental wellness, and the benefits of exercise as one of the strategies to combat depression. - CAJ News
