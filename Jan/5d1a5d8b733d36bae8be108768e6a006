The South Africa Cabin Crew Association has announced that it will be opening cases of corruption, theft and contravention of the Public Finance Management Act against executives and the board of South African Airways. This comes after the airliner sent messages to employees saying that there may not be money to pay their salaries at the end of June 2017.
