Namutumba &mdash; Patients at Nsinze Health Centre IV in Namutumba District have asked government to urgently construct a mortuary at the health facility.Daily Monitor has learnt that patients and bodies are sharing a ward since the facility has been operating without a mortuary for the last 30 years, a development that has irked both patients and health workers.According to Mr Tom Kamisa, the officer in charge of the health facility, lack of a mortuary has caused congestion at the health facility.Mr Kamisa said some patients have started shunning the facility for fear of sharing wards with bodies.To deal with the situation, he said: "We have been forced to divide the male wards into several potions so that we can create some space for keeping the dead bodies."He continued: "That, however, seems to have created another problem--foul smell. And for that our patients are having problems eating or even taking there medicine, thanks to the stench emanating from the corpses."Mr Kamisa said the matter has been raised many times with the district authorities, including the district health officer and the chief administrative officer, but nothing tangible has been done to yet to solve the problem.The chairperson of Nsinze management committee, Mr John Baligeya Azalwa, when contacted last week, said the facility has been operating without a morgue for more than 30 years."The room that was previously serving as a mortuary was destroyed by a heavy rain. In the last 30 years, we have nothing like a mortuary here," Mr Azalwa said.Patient speaks outMr Babalanda Waiswa, one of the patients this newspaper spoke to, said 'we spend most of the nights awake fearing disturbances caused by the spirits of the dead'.Namutumba District health officer Dr James Kirya was not readily available and his known telephone number couldn't be reached by press time.
