Before it escalates further, we need serious intervention."Unemployment contributes immensely to drug addiction, that's why they need assistance."Meanwhile, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Yobe State yesterday lamented the increasing rate of drug abuse and consumption among females.Commander of the Agency, Apeh Reuben said in Damaturu at a press conference on illicit drug abuse in the state."Our investigations on drug abuse in Yobe State indicated that young girls between the ages of 15 and 35 were increasingly involved in drug abuse. Some of the females consume tramadol, amphetamine and cannabis," he said.He added that with the alarming increase in drug abuse, there should be coordinated partnership with the Yobe Government to curtail the trend to save lives and property."This will be in the interests of affected individuals and the state in general," he stated.He stressed that failure to address drug abuse and consumption would have devastating consequences on future generations of the state, adding that this is the right time to act, before it is too late to address the menace.
