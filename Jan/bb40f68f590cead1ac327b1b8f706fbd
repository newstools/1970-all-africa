Among prominent politicians to participate at the summit scheduled for May include host president, Muhammadu Buhari, his Ghana counterpart, Nana Akufo-Addo and Ugandan head of state, Yoweri Museveni. Former Nigerian president and statesman, Olusegun Obasanjo, will also attend. They will be joined by captains of industry and commerce at the event dubbed Africa's most important meeting of international and African specialists, investors and financiers driving development in key sectors:power, natural resources, transport and logistics and heavy industry. "It is the must-attend gathering this year for anyone seeking to meet project owners and developers as well as those seeking to partner with potential investors and financiers," AFC stated. Lagos-based AFC is celebrating its tenth anniversary and the organisation believes the attendance of the political leaders is befitting. "We have confirmations from the Presidents of Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda as well as high level business and government delegations from across Africa." The summit set for May 15-16 will cover a wide range of themes including tested strategies, structures and mechanisms for ensuring projects are bankable, as well as best practices for increasing deal flow and achieving financial close on transactions within the infrastructure asset class.
