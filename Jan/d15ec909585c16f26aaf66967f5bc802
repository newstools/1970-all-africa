On Monday, South Sudan president Salva Kiir launched the National Dialogue for peace. The initiative was earlier delayed because there was intent to bring onto the negotiation as many players. A 94-member committee has been inaugurated to steer the talks, with President Museveni attending the launch.But the people of South Sudan should embrace unconditional unity in order to move the country forward. And this is why South Sudanese should appreciate Mr Museveni's warning that any misuse of one ethnicity against another could paralyse the world's youngest country. As President Museveni again cautioned, Juba should deem this round of national dialogue as "serious political capital which should not be squandered."This is not the first time Mr Museveni steps in to lend a hand at stabilizing Uganda's neighbour to the north. Mr Museveni's efforts during the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 that freed South Sudan from the grip of the Republic of Sudan, coupled with his efforts at ensuring the civil war that broke out in December 2013 did not spiral into genocide, are all pointers of a good neighbour lending a much needed helping hand.At the same ceremony, Mr Museveni urged the Juba government not to forget to involve the private sector in the dialogue. "If you don't have peace in the country, the private sector will run away and the country's economy will decline."Regrettably, both presidents Kiir and Museveni are loudly silent on the conspicuous exclusion of Mr Kiir's political rival Dr Riek Machar, who is central to any ceasefire and national dialogue.This is why Uganda should play a central but neutral arbiter's role in the South Sudan crisis.In sum, South Sudan remains Uganda's most active trading partner in the region; importing both foodstuffs and manufactured products.And the continuation of the war in South Sudan disadvantages Uganda in several respects.In 2103, Uganda's earnings from her exports to South Sudan took a nose dive from about Shs271 billion to about Shs54.2 billion monthly.This indicated an 80 per cent drop in two months thus exerting pressure on our foreign exchange earnings from exports. It therefore comes as no surprise that our economy is bleeding as a result of the deficit in our balance of trade, resulting from reduced dollar inflows.This is why Museveni's efforts to win back peace in South Sudan is a step in the right direction to winning back our share of market for our import goods and foreign exchange. But this should be as a good neutral neighbour not seen as supporting or favouring either side in the South Sudan power contest.
