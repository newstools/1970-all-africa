The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) on Tuesday said it is set to hold talks with the European Union Air Safety Committee (ASC) of the European Commission (EC) to discuss the ban placed on Medview airline.A statement by Sam Adurogboye, NCAA's spokesperson, said the agency plans to resolve all discrepancies that would lead to lifting of the ban on Medview Airlines.Mr. Adurogboye explained that the move was part of a series of engagements with the European Commission (EC) in the aftermath of a failed application by Medview Airlines for a Third Country Operator Authorisation to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."The application failed during the verification of documents submitted by airline which were found to be non-compliant with Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 and therefore could not qualify for approval," the statement said."The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) thereafter received the notification of non-compliance through the office of the Nigerian Mission to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)."Upon receipt of notification Muhtar Usman, the Director General, NCAA, met with senior officials of European Commission in Gaborone, Botswana, during the Regional Safety Oversight Organization Conference in February of this year. During this meeting extensive discussions were held with a view to resolving the matter."Similarly, the Regulatory Authority engaged Medview Airlines to straighten out issues arising from the failed application to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."However, the EU Air Safety Committee invited NCAA and Medview for a tripartite meeting in Brussels on the 25th - 26th April, 2017. After the deliberations, the European Commission (EU) with the full support of the EU Air Safety Committee unanimously decided to ban Medview Airlines," the NCAA said in the statement.The ban, the statement said, was in accordance with the common criteria set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005.The Union's list of air carriers which are subject to an operating ban within the Union should be amended to include Medview Airlines in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 474/2006, it said, adding that the ban will take effect a day after it is published in an official journal."The Commission expressed its readiness to reconsider the inclusion of Medview Airlines on the EU Air Safety List as soon as all issues of non-compliance are resolved with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."In addition, as part of the efforts to arrive at a resolution and lifting of the ban, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) will conduct a full scale audit of Medview Airlines' operations. The result would therefore determine further actions and engagements by the Regulatory Authority," the statement said.Medview Airline was last week banned from operating within the airspace of the European Union, EU by the European Commission.A statement released by the commission had said that a total of 181 airlines, including Medview, were banned from the EU skies.But the airline in its reaction had said that the ban did not affect its London operations.
