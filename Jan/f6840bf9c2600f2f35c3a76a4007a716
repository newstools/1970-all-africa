Tourism sector remains key in driving radical socio-economic transformation in the provinceAll members of the North West Provincial legislature unanimously approved the department of tourism's budget for 2017/18 financial year. The over R245 million budget was presented by the Tourism MEC Desbo Mohono who ensured the house at large that her department will put the money to good use and continue playing a pivotal role in advancing the course of radical socio-economic transformation in the province.Mohono said that government's recognition of tourism as an industry that can drive economic growth is certainly encouraging and that radical socio-economic transformation is not just a buzz word nor is it just a fashionable statement to be made to appease the people. She said that there is a dire need for the Tourism sector to transform meaningfully and politicians are entrusted with the duty to ensure that this becomes a reality."This speaks to the management and ownership of the tourism portfolio in the province and also speaks to every one of us standing up for all sectors and making the radical changes that in the end will see all people benefiting out of the wealth of this country."The fruits of our freedom were not designed to be enjoyed by only a few. The majority of our people, especially the youth are awaiting their turn to play a meaningful role in our economy and we have to create a conducive environment for these young minds to get South Africa working", said MohonoShe added that the industry that is referred to as a sector which is labour intensive is also rewarding at the ultimate end. "More than ever before our government is looking to tourism for answers especially if we are to attain the economic growth we so desire. The Premier's call for the ACT economic pillar to take its rightful place is a resounding attestation to the importance of the sector as an important driver in transforming and enriching the lives of our people", added Mohono.Mohono highlighted that the sector was recovering from a decline experienced over the years. She said that the new financial year promises to be a year of strong growth especially domestically. "This means more jobs for our people, more business for our operators, tour guides and most importantly more revenue for our economy. It is reported by the World Travel and Tourism Council that in January over a million tourists arrived in our country, 15% more people than in January last year", highlighted Mohono.Mohono went on to emphasize that her department and it's board will ensure that they continue to rightly position the province as preferred destination of choice through the "A Re Yeng Bokone Bophirima" brand Property which is a broad and intensive marketing platform for both the department and it's entity."Our task is to showcase and offer more people the chance to voluntarily choose the North West Province as a destination for leisure, business travel, Safari , sport and health, to mention but a few. It will require extensive marketing and big plans to rebrand, reposition and renew Bokone Bophirima for the discerning tourist" she emphasized.In conclusion, Mohono said that her province has to stand above the rest and ensure that its unique propositions are not easy to duplicate to keep our competitive edge."Our game parks are amongst the best in the country and are malaria free. Our cultural offerings can put VTSD's on the map and to this end, the department is working on the VTSD Tourism Development plans which will set out offerings per VTSD locality", she concluded.Issued by: North West Tourism
