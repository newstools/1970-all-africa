Bugiri &mdash; Primary school teachers in Bugiri District have been accused of defiling pupils and promising them promotion to other classes.According to the survey conducted by World Vision Uganda, defilement cases in Bugiri have increased and caused school dropouts, especially among girls.The survey revealed that defilement cases are being settled by local leaders and the police where suspects are freed after paying money to the parents of the victim.World Vision project manager, Edward Kaukha, while handing over the report to the district leaders during a meeting held at the district headquarters on Wednesday, said the vice is mostly common in schools located in rural areas.The survey was carried out in three sub-counties of Nankoma, Nabukalu, and Buwunga. World Vision staff interacted with pupils who revealed that teachers fall in love with them.The survey also revealed that most of the teachers engaged in defilement are class teachers and head teachers.Mr Kaukha said there is need for government intervention into this matter in order to improve academic performance of the girl child, adding that some teachers are marrying off their own pupils.He said the unprofessional promotion of pupils has resulted into poor performance in Primary Leaving Examinations.Mr James Kalinaki, head of Nankoma Primary School, said defilement cases involving teachers had earlier happened in his school and cases were addressed to the courts of law.The district senior education officer, Mr Tenywa Kazungu, said the education department will this week carry out investigations into the matters raised to ensure that teachers engaged in defiling pupils are arrested and charged in the courts of law.
