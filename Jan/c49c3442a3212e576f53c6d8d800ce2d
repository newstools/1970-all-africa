The former police officer said that the situation was escalating because of the easy access both groups have to arms.Udah also said that a situation where culprits arrested were set free would continue to fuel the crisis. He said that it was the responsibility of the government to control the proliferation of small arms by manning its borders.He said that it was only in the sub-region that herdsmen still go about with their cattle, adding that ranching was the modern practice globally.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Benue and Ekiti governments recently enacted laws to check activities of herdsmen in their respective states.
