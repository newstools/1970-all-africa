Currently, the deal is only open to Pretoria congregants.He revealed he has signed contracts with leading vehicle companies such as Jaguar, Toyota and Mercedez Benz."What will happen is that our registered members will be going to any garage and buy a vehicle at a very low price."I will only be topping up and also act as a guarantor. The church has already paid half the price. Church members will be repaying very little per month," he said.Asked why making the deal, the Prophet said he wants to ease mobility challenges facing his congregants."Our evening services, especially on Friday and Mondays, ends very late. Sometimes they go until two or three in the morning. This presents a challenge for our members and we want to resolve it," he said.The Prophet--who is the founder and leader of ECG--underlined that the deal takes off this Thursday at the church's headquarters at Pretoria Showground in South Africa.He said the first 3000 vehicles will be brought to Pretoria Showground this Thursday to which the Prophet has already paid half.
