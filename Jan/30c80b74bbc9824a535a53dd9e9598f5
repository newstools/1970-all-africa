Pretoria &mdash; Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula will officially open the Defence Force Service Commission (DFSC) satellite office at SAS Wingfield, Cape Town, on Tuesday."The official opening of the satellite office in Cape Town is undoubtedly a step in the right direction and will be of great assistance to the work of the Commission, especially when one considers the mammoth task before them," said Minister Mapisa-Nqakula on Monday.Established in 2009, DFSC's mandate is to, among others, conduct research and make recommendations for improvement regarding remuneration and the conditions of service of members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).Besides conducting assessments of military bases in and around the country, the commission occasionally travels abroad to visit SANDF soldiers deployed in peacekeeping missions."The various visits have enabled the commission to gain insight into the unique issues affecting SANDF members and provide us with informed advice on how best we can endeavour to address such matters efficiently," the Minister said.Since its establishment, the DFSC has embarked on a number of benchmarking visits to other countries to study their conditions of service.
