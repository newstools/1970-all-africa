The event takes place in a highly relevant momentum as 2017 is celebrated as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, a global campaign lead by UNWTO."Guangdong, one of the top economic hubs in China, is one of the best examples of what is happening in China in terms of the links between development and tourism and therefore it is a perfect location to conduct this event" said UNWTO Secretary General, Taleb Rifai."We sincerely appreciate the agreement with UNWTO that includes a number of initiatives in the field of sustainable tourism and wildlife conservation, which are very much in line with our philosophy 'Wherever Chimelong goes, the happiness follows' as our CEO, Su Zhigang highlights," said Chen Wancheng, President of Guangdong Chimelong Group.Accounting for 6.3% of GDP, tourism is one of the most important sectors in Guangdong.
