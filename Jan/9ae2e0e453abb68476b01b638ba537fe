You have touched and helped thousands, you did wonders and I remember you telling me "life is too short Zee let me live it to the fullest", this very dark hour it makes sense why you always said those words to me. To your sons, you were a hero-some kind of superman. Anyone who has ever been in your presence knows what a charming person you were. You will be missed and remembered in so many ways. You were IVAN THE GREAT!" Ms Zari wrote.It had been 11 days from the time the 40-year-old, who's popularly known as the president of Rich Gang was admitted at the hospital and put on life support machines before his condition deteriorated yesterday morning.
