THE European Union (EU) has said Zimbabwe's civil society is weak on policy formulation and economic discourse and thus failing to shape the development agenda of the nation.The government has, since 2000, has been crafting controversial laws most of which have been blamed for driving away foreign direct investment and collapsing the country's economy.Such policy initiatives include the economic empowerment programme which government enacted in 2007.The legislation which continues to cause discord even in government with cabinet ministers interpreting it differently, gives majority stakes in foreign-owned business ventures to locals.Speaking to civil society and the media at a discussion titled EU-Zimbabwe Civil Society relations, What Went Wrong? which was organized by MISA-Zimbabwe's last Thursday, EU ambassador to Zimbabwe Philippe Van Damme, said local civil society was not pushing for policy review."The voice of civil society organisations is weak," said Ambassador Van Damme."Of course people speak out notably on human rights issues, but on developmental issues, and on policy issues your voice is hardly heard," said the EU, Harare representative.Ambassador Van Damme, said local media spaces were polluted with internal political parties' fights at the expense of real issues which affect the ordinary person."I do not see much of the debate in the media on policy issues, but I see a lot of debate on factionalism and speculative politics."But on developmental issue such as how to address health issues and the sustainable development goals, I hardly see people putting substantial contributions."Some of the issues which the civil society representatives raised in response to the EU' concerns about their passive voices included the continued existence of undemocratic laws such as the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) which the State uses to ban public gatherings organised by pro-democracy organizations.They also said the continued closure of the broadcasting sector to genuine private players was also stifling their voice.
