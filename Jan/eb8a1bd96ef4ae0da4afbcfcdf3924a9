Kaduna &mdash; The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has intensified aerial patrol and surveillance of the Abuja-Kaduna highway and the equivalent railway track to reinforce security following the closure of the Abuja airport and use of the Kaduna airport as alternative.The Air Force which had commenced aerial patrol of the Kaduna-Abuja highway over four months ago as a result of kidnapping, armed banditry, and cattle rustling, said weekend that it had now raised the tempo of its operation due to the increase in traffic on the highway and the railway track which runs from Rigasa in Kaduna to Idu in Abuja.Speaking in Kaduna over the weekend after inspecting the Kaduna International Airport, the Chief of Training and Operation (CTOP) of the NAF, Air Vice Marshal Abdullahi Iya said the NAF had deployed additional surveillance and combat assets to boost the air operation in support of the land forces.
