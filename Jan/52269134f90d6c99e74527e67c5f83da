The Nigerian army engineers are there within the available resources to do their best."But the moment we get the required support from the international community, I tell you the exercise is going to be accelerated," he said.Mr. Buratai had told journalists in Maiduguri that the army was only doing a limited demining of the area and that large-scale removal of mines would require the assistance of the UN and other relevant bodies.NAN
