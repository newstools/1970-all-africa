In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), complaints against the presumed perpetrators of sexual violence are on the increase. Over 3000 complaints were received by civilian and military jurisdictions in 2016, versus 2414 complaints in 2015. The increase is justified by a strong involvement of the military justice in addressing cases of rape.
