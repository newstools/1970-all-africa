They all managed to escape unhurt and we have immediately launched a probe into this incident," Mr Omollo said.The incident has also caused tension among residents of Tangul village.Mr Omollo said the government will repair the station and that all measures to secure the forest from destruction will be considered."We will not be intimidated. We want to make sure that this forest is protected and any bandit planning to torch trees should know that he will not succeed."Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy County Commissioner Eric Mulevu led a team of security officers to the area and appealed to the locals to provide police with any information that might lead to the arrests of the assailants."We have held several consultative forums with members of Sengwer community.
