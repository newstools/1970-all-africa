The judge said Kalungi made the wrong entries well knowing that it was for the purpose of paying fraudsters.Under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2013, any person convicted of such offence is liable to 15 years in jail. The offence of embezzlement under the Anti-Corruption Act attracts up to 14 years in jail upon conviction.Court also convicted Mubarak of conspiracy to commit a crime when he carried a bag containing $500, 000 (about Shs1.8 billion) from Serwamba to Kalungi and in turn he was awarded Shs15 million.Isaac Serwamba was convicted of failure to tell the truth about the origin of Shs255 million that was recovered from him, which belonged to his brother David Serwamba.The judge observed that his conduct shows he knew the money had been fraudulently obtained.However, the judge acquitted their co-accused Moses Kavuma on account that he was not captured on the surveillance camera footage and that he was truthful in his testimony during the trial, which clearly indicated to court that he was merely misled by Serwamba and his conspirators.Justice Tibulya will sentence the convicts today.
