Government desires to amend that impression, by improving the public health sector, and working more closely with the private health care delivery sector. So far there have been successes in reducing the frequency of strikes, improving attitude of health workers, promoting teamwork and supporting training."Commending the Reddington hospital management and the team of cardiologist for providing healthcare facilities and centres in the country to curb medical tourism, the Minister said, "This new centre we are here to commission today is a welcome development in that direction. Grays Cardiology Centre in fact sets the bar higher, in that it goes beyond the routine, to bring state of the art diagnostic and intervention capacity to Nigeria. We are proud that services that would have been found only in the top hospitals of technologically advanced countries, can be rendered right here, in the country, without need for passport, visa, airfare or other hurdles and expenses."He further said that Government, in addition to this, "specifically desires to encourage more private sector participants in health care delivery," adding that "The injection of private capital, management skills, innovation and discipline should lead to the modernisation of health care delivery in Nigeria and the overall improvement of the health system."
