TV news anchor Mwanaisha Chidzuga gave State House digital communications director Dennis Itumbi a dressing down after he claimed there were fake identity cards numbers with voters&rsquo; details in the register.On Thursday, Kenyans exposed the fact that sending random ID numbers like 0, 11 and 66 drew registration details from the newly unveiled voter verification SMS platform.Indeed, Nairobi News journalists sent the said numbers and obtained the details. Hours later, the details were unavailable with users being told to send a valid ID number.But it appeared Mr Itumbi might have joined the bandwagon a little late after the IEBC had fixed the issue. &lt;/ p &gt; &lt; p &gt; &lt; strong &gt; &amp; #8216;CALLING OUT LIARS&ldquo;Checking basic Facts and calling out the liars. Just sent 0 to the IEBC Verification portal. ..the response attached,&rdquo; posted Mr Itumbi on Instagram.He attached a picture of the messages asking him to reply with a valid number.But Ms Chidzuga gave him a piece of her mind.&ldquo;No Itumbi they just brought it down. I myself thought it was a hoax then sent the sms with 0 then 66 then 11 and got the sms with voters names polling station etc I can forward them to u..So kindly we are not just lying or spreading rumours as u claim bt geniune concerns. IEBC and the government should now address the issues raised by kenyans to avoid doubt or politicians using this as ammunition to discredit the whole process..Good PR also includes accepting there was a challenge but plans or processes are underway to sort it out. Dont take&hellip;And she was not yet done: &ldquo;Dont take the trust and faith that Kenyans have for granted, one day itaisha so pls can IEBC clean the register as promised retain their credibility and trust of Kenyans that they can deliver fair elections Its nt abt Jubilee or Nasa or independent issues this is abt KENYA and whoever wins the election let it be seen by all Kenyans that he won fairly&rdquo;While Itumbi did not pursue the argument further, his followers praised Ms Chidzuga for the wise words.
