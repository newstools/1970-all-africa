It talks about the dignity of labour and not a fast way of making money."I appreciate my fans for their support all this while. They are the true inspiration and reason I am still carrying on."I also want my fans to keep supporting me and also watch out for my new album "Why So Serious."Aramide, a graduate of Political Science from the University of Jos, first hit the limelight in 2014 with her hit song "Iwo Nikan".The album won her Best Vocal Performance (Female) at the 2015 edition of Headies.The multi-talented songwriter, who equally plays the saxophone and guitar, started her music career in 2006 at the 'Star Quest', a music talent show as 3rd Runners Up of the contestant.She was also part of the "Diva Unplugged" show in Jos in 2014.
