Higher and Tertiary Minister Jonathan Moyo has accused The Herald newspaper of carrying out a vilification campaign against him at the order of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Moyo is reportedly determined to stop Mnangagwa from succeeding the 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe but Mnangagwa seems to be fighting back through the state newspaper.
