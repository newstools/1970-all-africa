Kampala &mdash; Arrangements have been finalised for Ugandan medical professionals to get employment in Libya, in the move to enhance the fight against unemployment in the country.Under the arrangement, a total of 300 doctors are needed, 600 nurses and 600 laboratory technicians are required.Mr Gordon Mugyenyi, the managing director of Middle East Consultants, a local recruitment agency, said the professionals are required to submit their Curriculum Vitae and academic documents to prepare for interviews which will be conducted tomorrow and Friday."This is the first time to recruit professionals since we started this business of external recruitment. And we are expecting more to come," said Mr Mugyenyi while addressing journalists in Kampala on Monday.He said that the successful candidates will qualify for free return air tickets upon completing a two-year contract with the employing institution as well as other necessities.Currently, Uganda earns more than $1.1 billion annually from migrant workers from the different parts of the world.Gender, Labour and Social Development minister Janat Mukwaya described the move as welcome and asked qualifying candidates to take up the opportunity."I am happy that the jobs are found.
