Imagine Maureen Rutabingwa, alias Mo Roots, Ann Nassanga, alias Afrie, Apio Lillian Moro, Sandra Suubi, Ife Piankhi, Rehema Nanfuka, Esther Ariho, alias Essie, Roshan Karmali, Zoey the Poet and Siima Sabiiti in one room telling stories and making music.That was the story of Courtinho Kemiyondo's 'A Ka Dope' edition that took place at Bold Africa, a fashion collection outlet at Acacia mall.This particular edition was unique. It wasn't happening according to Kemiyondo's known script for the show; it was taking place in what could be called a boutique, only programmed women, and had more artistes than she had ever done in a single session.This was a recording of BBC and Iowa Public Radio's 'Across Women's Lives,' a radio show that profiles women around the world. According to the producers, they are stepping away from journalism that tends to profile suffering, especially while reporting on Africa.The showcase was like many others that have happened in makeshift locations; the audience was seated on cushions spread out on Bold Africa's floor. One by one, the ladies-only show took the audience to the highs and lows, with stories on heartbreak with Apio's Ajok or celebrate heritage with Mo Roots' Kings and Queens."Uganda has talent; you don't need to go far to find it," said one of the people in the room.Essie, one of the first performers of the night, is mostly remembered for her show-stopping opening at the just-ended Blankets and Wine. Her music is basically Afro-fusion with a touch of Soul that mostly talks about love.She would later back up Apio, who Kemiyondo described as a storyteller who sings. Afrie's passion then serenaded the house on Let Her Know, her latest release that glorifies the African girl.But the tricks that came out of the box were from non-singers, including Siima, an instrumentalist and radio personality with XFM. There were presentations also from actress and spoken-word artiste Nanfuka, Ife and Roshan.Nanfuka shared her experiences on being a woman through a poem written as a letter to her 19-year-old self. She was well received, especially because she was talking about things many people in the audience have been through.
