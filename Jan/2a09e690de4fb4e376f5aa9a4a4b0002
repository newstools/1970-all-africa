So I decided to have another collaboration with Jah Prayzah and a new project with Oliver Mtukudzi,&rdquo; said the vivacious singer.She said her growing fan base in Zimbabwe inspired her to record songs with local artistes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zimbabwe is a good country and that explains why I decided to do a song in Shona to show how I love its people,&rdquo; she said.She hailed Zimbabwean artistes for their immense talent and professionalism.&ldquo;When I came for Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s album launch some years back, I discovered that the country has got talent and it is encouraging as it opens doors for us to work with them,&rdquo; said Charma.She also encouraged artistes to remain united in entertaining their fans.&ldquo;We should not act like politicians. In fact, politicians appear to fight in public yet they work together in the background and fool the people into fighting. As musicians, if we are to fight let us have battles on stage through our music.&rdquo;
