An 11th-hour meeting between protesting residents of Ha-Mutele and the Kruger National Park's management on Tuesday put the brakes on a protest at the park's Pafuri gate.On Monday, villagers of Mutele and surrounding areas began protesting to demand that SANParks include them in its social and labour programmes.They complained that the park was overlooking its youth and the unemployed when making appointments.On Tuesday, they blocked the Pafuri gate, prompting the park management to call a meeting with disgruntled residents.SANParks spokesperson William Mabasa told News24 that they wanted to find solutions."We sent our delegation to meet with residents, and part of the suggestion is to engage government on possible partnerships with extended public works programmes."Mabasa said jobs were available for all those who qualified. Rubble and barricades on the road leading to the gate would be removed.Source: News24
