The diplomats said that the main message they intended to send out during the celebration was friendship, peace, reconciliation forgiveness and asking for it and using their past experiences to provide lessons to the pearl of Africa.Stephanie Rivoal, the French envoy to Uganda said that they intend to hold these celebrations which mark "the bloodiest military conflict between nations," annually."There is a certain level of trust between Uganda and France because someone who doesn't trust you will not bring you to handle their military.
