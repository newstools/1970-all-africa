M-Net has acquired the broadcasting rights to This Is Us , 2017's best reviewed and highest rated new TV series for 2017.M-Net is five months behind with the new show that's getting rave reviews but has now acquired the show.This Is Us is scheduled to start in May 2017 on the M-Net (DStv 101), making the broadcasting gap between America and South Africa even bigger.M-Net made the announcement for the very first time directly on television on M-Net on Sunday afternoon during the first episode of M-Net's new weekly update show, The 101 .Presenter Donovan Goliath surprised by announcing that M-Net has acquired the broadcasting rights to This Is Us and will start showing it from sometime in May this year.It's from America's NBC network and if you're old enough to remember thirtysomething that was on the SABC's TV1 - This Is Us gives viewers those exact family and friends feels, updated for this decade.If you're younger, think Party of Five , My So-Called Life and Brothers &amp; Sisters .So good is This Is Us , that it's already been renewed for a second and a third season both in America - a huge vote of confidence from American network television in a prime time drama, where most shows struggle to just get a one season renewal at a time.The first episode of This Is Us is a doozy and has a big, big twist right at the end. Don't read up about the show, don't look online, just tune in, in May and watch it without reading things about it.It starts with all of the main characters who are getting ready to celebrate their 36th birthdays - on the same day. Of course they have divergent lives, each with their own emotional and life challenges.They are all connected somehow (you find out pretty quickly how, for some of them) and it's brilliantly written and executed.Yes. In 2017 there's still really great television, with This Is Us that tells stories that surprise you in a way you've really never seen before, packs real emotional heart, pulls you in, and compels you too keep watching and to come back for another episode.The wonderful cast includes Milo Ventimiglia, Mandy Moore, Sterling K Brown, Chrissy Metz, Justin Hartley and Gerald McRaney ( Major Dad ).Source: Channel24
