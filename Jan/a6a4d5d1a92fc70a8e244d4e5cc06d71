Bongo Flava star Diamond Platinumz has said he would rather do a collabo with his nemesis Ali Kiba than with his romantic partner.Zari is not just a shrewd businesswoman but also a budding musician, having released songs like "Toloba", "Hotter Than Them" and "Nkaaba the Boss Lady". She put her musical career on hold after getting hitched to Diamond back in 2014.Diamond made his feelings known about a possible collabo minutes before his performance at Koroga Festival while addressing students.ALREADY STOPPED DOING MUSIC"When I met Zari, she had already stopped doing music. Labda tusingekuwa pamoja kwa sababu najua songombwingo za muziki (And maybe if she was still doing music we wouldn't have been together because I know the challenges that come with being a musician)." Inawezekana Mwenyezi Mungu alimwambia aache muziki ili tukutane, tutengeneze familia nzuri ili tuwe mfano kwa jamii, pengine angekuwa mwanamuziki ningeona dadangu hii ni stress."(Maybe God told her to stop doing music so we could meet, start a family and be a good example to the society. Perhaps we would be stressed if she was a musician.)Diamond then added that he would rather do a collaboration with Ali Kiba than with his baby mama. However, it will be remembered that when Zari seeing Diamond after meeting in South Africa, both of them denied the claims that they were an item, saying that they were working on a joint music project.
