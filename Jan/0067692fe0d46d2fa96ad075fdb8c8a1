In most cases, the hackers are out of our border which makes it hard for us to investigate. Most hackers are traced in Eastern Europe," he said.However, the hackers reportedly divert the stolen money through China, Japan, US, Tanzania and UK.The 2014 annual crime report, which was the last released crime report, shows that Shs11b was lost in email hacking alone.Hackers first targeted big financial institutions but they haven't been successful in many cases without the help of insiders.e-mail hackingIn email-hacking, the suspects compromise the victim's email and capture or monitor confidential business information.
