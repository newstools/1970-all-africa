The Miss World Kenya Franchise has begun its search for the 2017 King and Queen. The franchise urged interested participants to register for the Mr and Miss World 2017 Pageant before the deadline of 26th of May, 2017.Previous winners have enjoyed tremendous success. Last year, Miss Evelyn Njambi was crowned Miss World Africa, and was ranked number five internationally, while Kevin Owiti won the Mr World Africa title, becoming the fourth most handsome man in the world.This year being an election year, the Franchise skipped the county auditions to hold one major audition to be held at Nairobi's Two Rivers Mall, from 27th-28th of May, 2017. This will be followed by a short listing from 6th-7th June. Shortlisted contestants will then attend a boot camp from 25th June - 2nd July, all culminating into the Grand Finale at the CK Square at the Two Rivers Mall on 15th of July, 2017.If you think you have what it takes, don't miss the deadline!
