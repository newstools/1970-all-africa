We believe that if it is strengthened appropriately, then we will end the threat posed by Al-Shabaab to Somalia and the region," said the President.President Kenyatta also announced that Kenya will on March 25 host a Heads of State Summit for Igad member countries whose agenda will be to discuss a durable solution for refugees from Somalia."I think the conference shows that Kenya is willing to consult, and ready to listen to the views of those who wish Somalia and the region well," said President Kenyatta as he invited the UN boss to attend the conference.President Kenyatta thanked Mr Guterres for showing enthusiasm to work with Kenya and Africa for collaborative answers to the problems that still trouble the region and the continent."A clear sign of that commitment is the Secretary-General's reaffirmation of the vital place of UNEP, HABITAT and UNON as key institutions hosted in the global South," said President Kenyatta.Mr Guterres said the UN is ready to support the Government of Kenya to achieve sustainable development goals.He also thanked the Government of Kenya for its continued support to the United Nations offices in Nairobi, which he said are being used to the maximum to support operations in other parts of Africa and the world.Mr Guterres thanked Kenya for its commitment to peacekeeping as well peace enforcement in Somalia and other parts of the world."Kenyan forces have played a very important role that I would like to underline here publicly and to express our deep gratitude and respect," said the UN boss.Mr Guterres called for more support for the African Union Mission in Somalia in order to complete the job of ensuring working State functions in Somalia."It is the moment for the international community to be more clear in its support for AMISOM that has been an extremely important element in the fight against terrorism.Mr Guterres, who visited Somalia yesterday, said he has come back with hope from the country and called on the international community to rise up in support of the efforts to ensure there is a functioning State that can collect taxes to serve and defend its people.
