Miss Tourism Zimbabwe (MTZ) benefactor Justice Maphosa says talks to breathe life into the country's flagship pageant, Miss Zimbabwe, are on course after it failed to take off last year.Maphosa through his company Big Time Strategic Group put up a world-class ceremony of the rebranded MTZ in addition to a colourful build-up while Miss Zimbabwe Trust shocked the nation when their auditions attracted a handful of models in addition to an uninspiring history so far.Responding to questions at a press conference to launch this year's competition last week, Maphosa rubbished views that relations between the two pageantries are frosty as widely perceived."The pageants are already talking because this is one Zimbabwe, one girl child although they are different categories and criterions. We do not want this to be seen as if it is a clash or competition," said Maphosa.When Barbra Mzembi took over the reins at MTZ last year there were reports that her appointment was through nepotism.Another school of thought also suggested she wanted to discredit the efforts of Marry Mubaiwa-Chiwenga, wife to commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, who is patron to the Miss Zimbabwe Trust that failed to send a representative at the last Miss World beauty pageant."The pageants are all serving their purposes with different criterions but as pageants we have already opened that platform," Maphosa explained.The business tycoon also hinted at a possible merging of the two pageants to come up with one queen that will represent the country at an international level."We are talking to Miss Zimbabwe and we coming up with synergies as to how to fuse and have the way forward on how these two pageants can work together and come up with one product that will go and represent one Zimbabwe, that is happening," he said.However, Miss Zimbabwe Trust spokesperson Tendai Chirau was in the dark when contacted for comment could neither confirm nor deny the supposed "talks"."There might be talks underway, but I cannot disclose yet because they might be happening at a higher level," said Chirau.He, however said the dates for the Miss Zimbabwe pageant were to be announced soon."As you are aware Miss Zimbabwe US was underway because we gave licenses to Zimbabweans in other countries to host pageants but now because it is done we are working on a few issues before we announce dates for our local pageant which will be soon," he said.Mzembi on the other hand could not be drawn to reveal if the prospects of a fusion hold any water opting to say "it depends who will be the winner"."We need to see the winner and get those [Miss World] requirements, equally the girl who comes from Miss Tourism can participate in Zimbabwe if the requirements are agreeing," said Mzembi.Apparently cementing Maphosa's suggestion Mzembi signalled uncertainty whether the next Tourism queen will attend Miss Tourism World despite last year's crown holder Ashley Morgen making it into the top 10 saying they are in search of other platforms this time around.After an epic first edition Mzembi registered her delight about the competition which she said managed to serve its main objective to "empower the girl child despite winning or losing"."We managed to promote not only the girl child but also Zimbabwe and all those who worked with us they have been saying thank you. I am very happy for the outcome," she said.Auditions for this year's Miss Tourism will start after September until November when only 15 finalists will be selected for a boot camp culminating into the final ceremony set for December 9.
