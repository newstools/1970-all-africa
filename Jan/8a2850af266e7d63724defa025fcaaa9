Five other suspected Islamist militants were arrested March 25 and 26 in Benue state.Following the announcement, the British government expressed its gratitude for the support of Nigerian security officials."We are in regular contact with the Nigerian security authorities concerning potential threats to UK interests in Nigeria," according to a statement released Wednesday.The U.S. embassy declined to comment on the situation.
