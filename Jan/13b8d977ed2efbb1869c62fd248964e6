Mogadishu &mdash; DOCTORS of the World, the medical rights group, has called for urgent reaction from the international community to facilitate humanitarian access in some conflict-torn and hunger-stricken countries in Africa. Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia are pummeled by hunger and disease owing to conflict and unfavourable weather conditions. "It is a chronic situation that has intensified in recent months, in countries and regions where humanitarian access is extremely difficult," said Jos&eacute; F&eacute;lix Hoyo, President of Doctors of the World (M&eacute;dicos del Mundo Espa&ntilde;a). He said the effects of climate change, natural disasters and conflicts influenced the emergence of famine. According to the medical rights group's teams in the field, the number of malnourished children who visit its centres has been growing steadily since last year. Among other crises, the nutritional situation is critical in Somalia where around 944 000 children under five suffer from malnutrition. About 6,2 million people (more than half of the population) are food insecure. Hoyo said although the alert was given several months ago, the risk of famine had increased with no political solutions provided to the conflicts. "We call for a diplomatic and financial mobilization of the international community," said Hoyo. Doctors of the World operates in Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. Its teams are assessing the possibility of expanding its work with new activities in besieged Ethiopia, Kenya and South Sudan. - CAJ News
