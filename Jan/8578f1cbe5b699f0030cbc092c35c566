The modern green hysteria about genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) and the corresponding fad for organic food is exposed as vapid and fact-free by their acceptance of food created by nuclear radiation but labelled "organic".It may surprise you that organic beer made with Golden Promise barley and organic Star Ruby grapefruit, like much of the world's beans and rice, come from plant varieties that were created by bombardment with nuclear radiation. They're mutants, with several traits that are beneficial to producers and who knows how many other, unexamined traits.Improving the agricultural and nutritional qualities of food crops had, for centuries, been a laborious, haphazard and slow process. For most of history, it was a process of selecting plants for favourable traits, which slowly improved the plant by what one might call unnatural selection.In the 19th century, Gregor Mendel conducted experiments with hybrid plants, founding the science of genetics. Based on this work, cross-breeding began to be used by farmers, anxious to increase the yield and hardiness of their crops. For every successful strain produced by cross-breeding, there were very many failures, but by the mid-20th century, hybrid seeds and new varieties were leading to a revolution in agriculture. The...
