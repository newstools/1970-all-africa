Dodoma &mdash; The Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Dr Harrison Mwakyembe on Monday asked musicians to stay out of politics and focus their energy on art.According to Dr Mwakyembe, there was no musician in the world who achieved stardom and registered commercial success by dissing their government."Go to Nigeria, Wizkid or Tiwa Savage are not singing about politics. Even in Uganda, Chameleone is not singing about politics. If you want commercial success, stick to music, leave politics to politicians," he said.The Minister said this as he was winding up his budget speech on parliament.Recently there has been a wave of Hip Hop tracks critical of the government's performance.Dr Mwakyembe also challenged all artists in the country to stop lamenting when their artistic rights are abused and instead take action."I congratulate two musicians, Ambwene Yesaya (AY) and Hamisi Mwinjuma (Mwana FA) who dragged Tigo to court for using their songs as ringtones without their permission. They were awarded Sh2 billion in a lower court but Tigo appealed and the matter is at High Court now," he said.
