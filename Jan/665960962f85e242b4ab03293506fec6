And based on our contacts before this meeting with officials of PENCOM, those of September will be settled in a short time as Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) to that effect has been received by PENCOM awaiting cash backing."Earleir NUP President Abel Afolayan assured that no stone would be left unturned in ensuring that necessary and enabling legistation is put in place for the amendment of the Pension Reform Act to open the gate for the full unionization of the sector under the umbrella of NUP.Represented by NUP Deputy General Secretary Chief J.A Okunade, he appealed to government at all levels to pay entitlements and pensions of pensioners as at when due so that pensioners who have served the nation meritoriously would not be thrown into abject poverty and sufferings.
