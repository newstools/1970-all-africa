Kaduna &mdash; It is wrong to drill boreholes in urban cities because of high level of pollution in such cities and depletion of ground water, an expert in Kaduna, Engineer Musa Nimrod has said.Nimrod said in an interview with Daily Trust that haphazard drilling of boreholes especially in new settlements should not be encouraged. "Boreholes are better encouraged in rural areas. We encourage pipe-borne water and not borehole for the urban areas because of the level of activities in the cities," he said.He said indiscriminate drilling of boreholes was also causing a gradual depletion of the ground, and that regulatory efforts were necessary in any case."By law, anything water is owned by government and is supposed to be regulated by government," he said, specifying that the Kaduna State Water Board was supposed to regulate anything that had to do with water in the state.He lamented however that a lot of residents had resorted to drilling of boreholes to get water because supply of pipe-borne water could not meet demand.
