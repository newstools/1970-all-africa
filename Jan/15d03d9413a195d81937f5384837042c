Our hope is to see an improvement in the reading culture of younger Africans and to build a growing community of readers."Even with the growing amount of non-paper options provided by our constantly changing technology age, many people still find it difficult to read printed material. This loss is now being felt in our cultural activities, in our policies and politics, as well as in our children's school scores. And it could get worse. A mode of thinking is being lost and we are missing out on the opportunity to experience new things and think intelligibly. The evidence that there is a decline in reading culture is substantial and spellbinding."Book Club Lagos is a group of who are committed to reading a book every month and meeting at the end of each month to discuss and share their thoughts on the book of the month.
