He sang the popular song 'Dabo Dabo' featuring D2 and 'Apotro' featuring Shilo.Funny Face has been off the stage for the past months, a development he said was necessitated by the search for money and marriage.He ended his two-year marriage to his long-time girlfriend Elizabeth Nana Adjoa Ntim in 2016 over cases of infidelity.He said he is working on getting married again. "The new marriage plan is going well, it's very necessary for me to re-marry."Unfazed by the challenges he faced in his previous relationship, the comedian said: "I am not scared of marriage, I will marry again and again, and I can't wait."He also described fellow comedian DKB as the king of comedy in the country.

You need to believe yourself and you will definitely make it," he said.He said all that matters in television and production is the quality of the content.
