The European Commission has announced a support package of &euro;143 million for recovery and reconstruction needs in Borno State, which is suffering from a worsening humanitarian crisis. A large proportion of the Borno population has little or no access to clean water, sanitation, shelter, education, primary healthcare (60% of health infrastructure is either destroyed or damaged), and is food insecure. Large parts in Borno state remain under threat from Boko Haram.
