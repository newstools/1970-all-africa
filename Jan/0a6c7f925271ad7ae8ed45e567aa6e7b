Abuja &mdash; There is anxiety in military circles over likely sack and prosecution of some top military commanders, following the January 19 bombing of Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs' camp, at Rann, Borno State, as the Nigerian Air Force investigative panel submitted its report in secret last week.This is even as Nigerian Air Force explained that its action in receiving the document in secret was because it lacked power to act on the report, given that the operation, which resulted in the ugly development was a joint military one.The report, which submission was carried out in secret by the Nigerian Air Force authorities, according to Vanguard sources, may have blamed some theatre commanders for the bombing.The receipt of the panel's report by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, last week from the six-member probe panel and forwarding of same to the Defence Headquarters for transmission to the Federal Ministry of Defence for onward transmission to President Muhammadu Buhari for perusal and necessary action, heightened the tension.A Nigerian Air Force source told Vanguard that the sensitive nature of the report necessitated the secrecy that trailed its submission.It was gathered that the committee fingered some theatre commanders who, upon receiving briefings on suspicion of perceived enemies or infiltration of Boko Haram terrorists in the camp, ordered the NAF pilots who had taken control of the air base of the area to drop bombs.Contacted on the issue, Director of Public Relations and Information of the Nigerian Air Force, Group Captain Ayodele Famuyiwa, confirmed that the probe panel submitted its report to the Nigerian Air Force authorities.He, however, did not state when the report was submitted just as he could not disclose the content.saying the Air Force was not aware of the content of the report which had been submitted to higher authorities." The Board has submitted its report and the Nigerian Air Force has sent it to the higher authorities because issues like that are not an Air Force affair, it's a national affair."Air Force is not the one in charge of the operation, the operation is a joint service operation. So the Air Force is not in charge of the operation, it's just that the incident involved the Air Force and being an aviation accident, it only takes the specialists in that field to investigate what happened."So, once the committee submitted its report, the Nigerian Air Force forwarded it to the higher authority, "he said.Asked to disclose where the report was submitted, Famuyiwa said: " I wouldn't know whether it's at the Defence headquarters or the Federal Ministry of Defence.
