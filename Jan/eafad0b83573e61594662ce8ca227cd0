Hot off his collaboration with Grammy Award winner Miri Ben-Ari, Israeli born Gilad Millo is back with an ode to his adopted city Nairobi, which he has called home for the past ten years.The Kenyan - based Millo teams up with Superband for this melodious song Nairobi Yangu, in which he describes Nairobi as the best city he's lived in comparing with other major world capitals such as New York and London among others.Like a solitary rose in full bloom in a garden full of exotic flowers - Nairobi is elevated and planted firmly in our ears as he croons about it being the only city in which he's found love.Nairobi Yangu, which was written during one of the city's infamous traffic jams, is a song that he hopes will position the Kenyan Capital as the leading business and arts hub in Africa, filled with fun loving people and a spirit of celebration and is an instant classic guaranteed to play on in our hearts and minds for generations to come.The music video, which was directed by Mushking, made a buzz in mid march when the Nairobi County arranged for the closing off of Mama Ngina Street for the shooting of a major scene in the video has received rave reviews with some viewers comparing Gilad to Midas who turned everything he touched into Gold.
