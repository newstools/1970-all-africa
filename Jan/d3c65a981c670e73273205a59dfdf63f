Nairobi &mdash; The Betting, Lottery, Gaming and Competition Industry has been hit the hardest in the 2017/ 2018 Budget after Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich raised the tax to a standard 50 percent.The uniform tax is for all categories and all the proceeds will be put in a newly created national sports, culture and Arts fund to support the youth involved in sports and culture in the country.The proposed new tax will affect betting, which is currently taxed at 7.5 per cent, lottery at 15 per cent and gaming taxed at 12 percent.Rotich attributes the move to the negative consequences the industry has caused to young Kenyans, though it is not clear if winnings will be taxed."Betting and Gaming have become widespread in our society in an environment that is inadequately regulated. Its expansion is beginning to have negative social effects in particular on the youth and the vulnerable members of the society," Rotich noted in his Budget Speech at parliament on Thursday.The move comes even as Gem Member of Parliament Jakoyo Midiwo had proposed a new bill to introduce new and higher taxes on the gaming industry.Gross revenues from the industry are estimated to be in the region of Sh3 billion and forecasts indicate that the industry will experience steady grow over the next five years according to tax expert from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) Maurice Lugongo.Lugondo says despite the steady growth of gambling in Kenya, the industry has faced several challenges such as low-profit margins as a result of high fixed costs, technological challenges, weak regulatory and institutional framework, intense competition, and an unclear tax policy."Winnings from the gambling businesses in Kenya have remained untaxed for a long period of time. The first attempt to subject such winnings to tax came in 2011 when the Finance Bill 2011 introduced a 20 percent withholding tax. The Finance Act 2012 however repealed this tax. The tax was later reintroduced through the Finance Act 2013.""The reintroduction caused an uproar from players in the sector who moved to court to petition the reintroduction on the basis that the legislation introducing the tax was unconstitutional as it was passed without public participation contrary to the Constitution. The court, however, dismissed this petition," explained lugongo.Two years down the line, Lugongo says, and with a vibrant gambling industry, tax revenues from the industry have been disheartening with gambling operators citing impracticability and difficulties in implementing the tax laws.Tax from betting companies has tripled in two years according to the Kenya Revenue Authority.READ: Tax from betting firms tripled in two years - KRAIn a presentation to Parliament's Labour and Social Welfare Committee last month regarding the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (Amendment) Bills 2016, KRA Commissioner General John Njiraini told MPs the fast-growing industry has helped expand the tax base.He said eight of the 25 licensed betting companies had paid a total of Sh4.7 billion in the financial years 2014/2015 and 2015/2016.He said other taxes from the industry such as PAYE, VAT and income tax are projected to more than double by the end of the current financial year 2016/2017 from Sh1.2 billion last to about Sh3.4 billion."The philosophy for taxing betting, lotteries and gaming revenues is partly to discourage gambling while also creating avenues for raising revenue. The application of this principle nevertheless requires moderation in relation to the imperative to ensure business continues to operate and thrive," Njiraini told the committee chaired by Matungu MP David WereBetting companies have been against the taxes citing that the business is a costly undertaking.
