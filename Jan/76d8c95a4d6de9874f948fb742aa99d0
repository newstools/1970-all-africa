Benin &mdash; The 4 Brigade of the Nigerian Army in Edo state yesterday denied media reports that its troop of 19 Battalion had a gun battle before it could arrest a suspected kidnapper, Mr. Sunday Okoro, aka 'GI' and six others at Sapele, Delta State.A statement signed by spokesman of the 4 Brigade, Captain Mohammed Maidawa and made available to journalists in Benin yesterday, said there was no shootout or gun battle during the arrest of Okoro and others."The Nigerian Army is replete with highly professional, loyal and dedicated officers that performed their duties diligently with great sense of responsibility and pride," he said.The statement also denied that the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Monday Igbuya, mounted pressure for the release of the suspects, as they were never handed over to them"It is therefore preposterous for anyone to allege anything untoward in the handling of the accused or the recovered abandoned vehicles and weapons," the statement said, adding that the items were handed over to the Delta State Police Command through appropriate channels for further investigation and prosecution.
