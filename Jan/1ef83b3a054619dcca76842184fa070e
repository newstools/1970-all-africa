On March 1st 2017, the Esperanza ship sailed to the Praia harbour in Cape Verde to begin its journey in West African waters. One goal: show local governments that there is a serious need for strong regional fisheries management.While transiting to our next destination, we are enjoying the surroundings of the great blue and its inhabitant. Whales came to visit us, for a swift and discreet welcome.As we get closer to the coast, birds start to follow the ship, hoping to dine on a quick meal, spying the waves we are making for an easy catch.One of them came a bit too close to the mast. He had a piece of fish net caught on his leg. Luckily, a crew member quickly stepped in, climbed the bow mast to free him.This is just the beginning of a 3 month tour we hope will help restore our African ocean.
