Following discussions on the 2017 hajj fares, the ITEC Consultancy Services has urged the Federal Government to urgently establish a business bilateral relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to enhance the nation's foreign exchange especially with the Kingdom's currency, the Riyal.The Director of the centre Abdulwakeel Ademola Abdulwahab made the call in Abuja after a two-day executive seminar on this year's hajj exercise.He said the centre agreed with the explanations of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) Chairman Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad that about 98 percent of hajj fare components are dollars based, hence the high fare due to the high dollar rate compare to naira."We believe much can still be done to have a reasonable concessional exchange rate for the exercise by various government agencies especially National house of Assembly, Presidency, Central Bank of Nigeria and NAHCON."As for this year Hajj, we recommend that the State Pilgrims Boards should embark on local or in house arrangement to pair the Pilgrims in order to harmonize the uniform $800 BTA by getting the list of those who do not need such much money and those who want $1000 or above BTA. Those who want less BTA will only add up the amount needed for their BTA to their initial deposit while the balance would be made up by the paired Pilgrims that need more," Abdulwahab said.He said the Hajj savings scheme should be taken serious so that it will ease the payments of hajj fare by the prospective pilgrim in future.
