The Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance has raised concerns over President John Magufuli's stance on the expulsion of Tanzanians living illegally in Mozambique. "If the immigrants did not ask for any assistance when they were leaving the country illegally, we are under no obligation to send them vehicles now that they are coming back," said Magufuli.
