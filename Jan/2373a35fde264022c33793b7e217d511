Stinking waste water bubbles up out of the ground at the entrance to a children's day-care centre in Ndlovini, Port Alfred.Nande Ngogela, a manager at Sinoyolo Daycare, said they had reported the matter in October 2016 to the Ndlambe municipality, which had promised to fix the leak, but nothing had been done, GroundUp reported.The underground sewer pipe is connected to several homes and to Sinoyolo."I don't know if Ndlambe municipality is considering the lives of these kids," said Ngogela.Nomthandazo Nkohla, a teacher at Sinoyolo, said they constantly had to check that the children did not go near the sewage. There are 42 children at Sinoyolo."This pipe has affected how we do things in this centre. We don't want our kids to get sick, so we make sure that most of the time they are inside," she said.Municipality spokesperson Khululekile Mbolekwa said workers would be sent to fix the problem."The municipality is engaging in a programme targeting all the households to check if they are encountering any problems with their pipes," he said.Source: GroundUp
