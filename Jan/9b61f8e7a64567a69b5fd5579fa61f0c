African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat called on South Sudan conflicting parties to refrain from escalating violence.In a press statement issued Sunday, the chairperson expressed his deep concern over the increasing military clashes in South Sudan, especially in the restive Upper Nile region.Mahamat particularly urged the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition/SPLM/IO and other armed movements in South Sudan to immediately abstain from fighting.The chairperson said: "The renewed fighting in South Sudan is a clear indication that the warring parties continue to believe in a military solution, fully disregarding the plight of innocent civilians which they claim to represent and defend.""The immediate consequences of the military clashes on the civilian population are shattering and therefore it should be understood that those engaging in this callous behavior should be held accountable," he added.The chairperson further called on the coalition government and other warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and uphold their responsibilities to protect civilians.He also affirmed AUC's commitment to support South Sudanese peace process by various means.
