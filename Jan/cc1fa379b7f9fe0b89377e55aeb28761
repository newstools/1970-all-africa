London &mdash; Demand from process and manufacturing industries in East Europe bolster growth, finds Frost &amp; Sullivan's Industrial Process Control teamStrong demand for welding equipment and consumables from process and manufacturing industries in emerging East European economies will help to offset the limited expansion opportunities of vendors in Central Europe. High adoption rates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary will see the overall European markets for welding equipment and consumables experience a compound annual growth rate of 3.5 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, between 2016 and 2021. By strictly complying with the evolving energy regulations within the European Union (EU), welding equipment manufacturers in the region can also edge out low-cost imports from Asia."While the market for welding equipment and consumables is very mature with low scope for innovation, increasing energy efficiency in segments such as arc welding and resistance welding offers the potential to win new projects," said Industrial Process Control Industry Analyst Sivakumar Naryanaswamy. "Educating customers on the benefits of energy efficiency and demonstrating the cost and energy savings that can be achieved is vital to success."Analysis of Welding Equipment and Consumables Market in Europe, Forecast to 2021, recent research from Frost &amp; Sullivan's Industrial Automation &amp; Process Control Growth Partnership Service programme, examines welding equipment and consumables demand in end-user industries such as energy, automotive and transportation, construction, heavy industry, shipbuilding, and process across Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe as well as the UK and Ireland. In addition to growth potential, the study identifies strategic imperatives from major contenders such as ITW, Lincoln Electric, ESAB and Bohler Welding. The insights cover power sources used for arc welding, such as inverters, generators and transformers; equipment technology such as arc welding, resistance welding, gas welding, and laser welding; and consumables such as submerged arc welding flux and wire, flux cored wire, stick electrode, and solid wire.Click here for complimentary access to more information on this analysis and to register for a Growth Strategy Dialogue, a free interactive briefing with Frost &amp; Sullivan's thought leaders.With the slow year-on-year growth of the construction market in Central Europe and uncertainty due to the 2016 UK referendum to exit the EU, welding equipment and consumables manufacturers must identify new channel partners to cater to an expanding customer base. Such collaboration is vital to enhance visibility through sales and service support as more than 90 percent of welding equipment and 95 percent of consumables are sold through distributors, dedicated partners, and system integrators."Since the Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) sets a minimum efficiency level for transformers introduced into the European market, welding equipment suppliers can also source the latest high-grade transformers from ABB or Siemens," noted Industrial Process Control Research Manager Anand M Gnanamoorthy. "These will comply with higher energy efficiency in arc and resistance welding modules and stay relevant even with further amendments to EU energy regulations."About Frost &amp; SullivanFrost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.
