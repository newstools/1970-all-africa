Anyway, it's your choice, you played the game the best way you know how to."ThinTallTony who is married with two kids hid his marital status during his stay in the house before he got evicted.The dancer had earlier stated in an interview that he had an agreement with his wife, Laraba Offiong to keep his family private.
