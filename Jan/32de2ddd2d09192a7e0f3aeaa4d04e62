Maiduguri &mdash; Borno State recorded 530 cases of cholera infections as at September 5 this year. Also, 23 deaths were documented during the period.The United National Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, who made the disclosure while fielding questions from reporters yesterday in Maiduguri, noted that the outbreaks took place in parts of the capital as well as Jere, Monguno and Dikwa council areas.According to the UN official, humanitarian partners were putting in place measures to check the spread of the water-borne epidemic, especially in camps harbouring internally displaced persons (IDPs) across the state.He said although an outbreak has not yet been declared officially, Kallon, however, said they were being proactive by setting treatment centres in the affected metropolis and council areas.His words: "The outbreak is mainly in Muna Garage, a camp hosting no less than 20, 000 IDPs on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the state capital. It was first reported by the Ministry of Health. The first case was on August 16, 2017."Over 530 suspected cases had been registered as of September 5, 2017, including 23 deaths (4.3 per cent fatality rate)."He continued: "Although most cases have been identified in Muna Garage camp, others have been identified in Custom House, Ruwan Zafi and Bolori II, all camps located near Muna Garage."We have received reports of a suspected cholera outbreak in Monguno and Dikwa council areas located north and east of Maiduguri."On the incessant outbreaks, Kallon said: "The latest figures suggested a 4.3 per cent fatality rate - well above the one per cent rate that the World Health Organisation rates as an emergency."The short incubation period of two hours to five days means the disease could spread with explosive speed."He, however noted, that the State Ministry of Health, Rural Water and Sanitation Agency and humanitarian organisations, including UN agencies, were responding to the crisis.He added that an Emergency Operational Centre had been set up to manage the response, while the state's Ministry of Health had established a 30-bed Cholera Treatment Centre with the support of humanitarian partners in Muna Garage camp.
