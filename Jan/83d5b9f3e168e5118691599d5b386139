US growth in 2017 remains at 2.2% and the Euro-zone at 1.7%, while Japan's growth forecast was revised up to 1.4%. The forecasts for China and India remain unchanged at 6.5% and 7.0%, respectively, in 2017."Projected oil demand growth for 2017 was also unchanged at 1.27 mb/d to average 96.38 mb/d. OECD consumption is seen growing by 0.23 mb/d in 2017, in line with the previous report, following offsetting revisions in OECD Americas and Asia Pacific. The forecast for oil demand growth in China and India have also been left unchanged at 0.34 mb/d and 0.12 mb/d, respectively."However, Dr. Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, has stressed the importance of dialogue as an instrument to stabilising the global market."We have just completed a marathon round of meetings in Vienna, where the OPEC and non-OPEC countries have agreed to continue working together as part of the Declaration of Cooperation in order to ensure that we achieve a balanced market sooner rather than later."To get there, we will need to see the continued joint efforts of the OPEC and participating non-OPEC nations, which, thus far, have proven to be effective and have led to signs of market rebalancing and a generally more positive mood in terms of market sentiment. HE Alexander Novak and HE Khalid A. Al-Falih both alluded to these historic decisions and how they took us one step closer to our goal of re-establishing a balanced market."
