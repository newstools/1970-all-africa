The county government of Nyeri has vowed not to pay doctors salaries for the 100 days they were on strike even as they threatened to boycott work on Thursday.According to county Health Executive Charles Githinji, who is also the acting Finance executive, the return-to-work formula the doctors signed did not indicate that they were to be paid for days they were on strike."The position of the national government, the Council of Governors, and the county government is that we can only pay for work done. It is illegal for them to demand pay for days they did not work," he said.For three months, services in public hospitals were paralysed leading to hundreds of deaths and agony for patients who could not afford private health care.CENTRAL REGION STRIKEMore than 400 doctors from four central region counties have vowed to down their tools Thursday that if the government does not pay their three-month salary arrears.But Dr Githinji denied receiving any notice on the planned strike, saying the doctors have to follow the right procedure."No one has notified me of any strike and any action they choose to take without following the right procedures will be sorted in a legal way," he said.He said the doctors were to serve the county with a notice 21 days ago to give room for dialogue.According to the Central region Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) Secretary-General Gor Goody, the government has no goodwill to address their salary issue as insisting that it has failed to implement the return-to-work formula.CAN'T AFFORD BASICSThe doctors lamented that they can no longer afford basic needs because they have no money after missing pay for three months.But Dr Githinji downplayed the claim, saying that it is clear that the return-to-work formula did not say they were to be paid for days they did not work."No clause in the return-to-work agreement indicates the employer would pay for days the doctors were on strike. It (only) clearly states that the employer would not victimize the doctors who participated in the strike," he said.He added that the doctors will be paid starting March 14 when they resumed duty.On average, a doctor receives Sh180,000 per month, according to Dr Githinji.
