The couple separated in 2015 following a filing of a divorce suit by Suzanne, who accused Emeka Ike of domestic violence. The court granted Emeka the custody of the four children but ordered that their mother should be granted unhindered access to them, adding that any party that is dissatisfied with the judgement should appeal within 30 days.
