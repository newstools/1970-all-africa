The US government has suspended US, including USAID direct assistance to the Ministry of Health until such a time that certain "specific conditions are met."In a letter signed by Brian Woody, the USAID/Kenya and East Africa contracting officer says activities such as salaries and wages, operations, domestic and international travel as well as meetings and workshops have been suspended.It is not clear how long this suspension, that will affect national level programs handled at Afya House, will be in place or what instigated it.INFORMAL MEETINGHowever, the suspension was communicated to the Kenyan government on May 4 according to Mr Woody's letter."Any activities conducted with the MoH during the period of suspension will not be reimbursed by the United States government," says the letter dated May 8.Further, Mr Woody in the two-page letter, says they will meet with representatives of the affected programs on Wednesday morning for an informal meeting at the Lord Errol hotel in Nairobi.The US Embassy will issue a statement on the issue on Tuesday.Efforts to get word from the Ministry of Health on the letter was futile as the Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu did not respond by the time of going to press.
