The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) South-West Chapter in the United Kingdom has urged the two principal actors in the crisis rocking the party at the centre to step aside in order to ensure peace and progress.The chapter made the declaration after its bi-quarterly meeting held in London, emphasising that the warring factions led by Ahmed Makarfi and Ali Modu Sheriff were only after their selfish interests.The body called on the duo to immediately sheathe their swords, honourably step aside for selfless party members to organise a national convention as a matter of priority.In a communiqu&eacute; issued and&lrm; signed by Otunba Kenny Aluko (chairman) and Niyi Ajayi (secretary), respectively, the PDP members in the diaspora said the party remained indivisible and would continue to uphold its values and tenets irrespective of any threat either within or outside.The chapter further said it was prepared to use all available resources in checkmating perceived party members fuelling the crisis.
