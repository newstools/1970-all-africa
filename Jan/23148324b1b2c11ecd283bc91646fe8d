The gallant officers include: 'Brown' who is in charge of schematic ,'Pinky', who is in charge of interrogation, and 'Edge', the head of the Special Anti-Crime Unit of the Police Force."Mr. Odiase noted that like many security officers, the anti-crime squad members paid some costly prices in their passionate service to their country.He added that the scenario was to reassert the need to appreciate and support security officers in ensuring a safe society for all."In the process, Edge lost his daughter, and Brown lost his mother that was earlier kidnapped."Pinky on her part had to lose her relationship when she found out that her man was one of those terrorizing the state."All these clearly express the fact that our security men are human after all, they and their family also need protection", he added.The movie which was shot and produced in Abuja featured the producer, Mr. Odiase, as 'Edge', Chinyere Onah as 'Pinky' and Preach Bassey as 'Brown'.The cast include Sir K, Mikki Odey, Sunny Williams and Lizzy Ofuani, among others.
