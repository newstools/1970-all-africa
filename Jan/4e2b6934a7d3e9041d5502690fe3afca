Often times, people mistake the tanker drivers as drunken illiterates who goes about killing people, but they may not know that these people are human beings with similar domestic and workplace challenges like any other person. This movie will go a long way to unravel the challenges they go through and at the same time foster our collaborations with FRSC, which aids in keeping tabs on the drivers. We will also try to intensify training for the drivers to understand the danger of not keeping rules while driving."
