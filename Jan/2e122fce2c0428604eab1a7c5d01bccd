NAMIBIANS are the third wealthiest people in Africa, according to an April 2017 report by Mauritius' AfrAsia Bank and Johannesburg-based market research firm New World Wealth.According to the report, the average wealth of a person living in Namibia (wealth per capita) was US$10 800 (about N$142 500) in 2016, up from US$10 200 (about N$132 600 ) in 2015.Mauritians were found to be the wealthiest in Africa, with US$25 700 (about N$339 000) in wealth per person. At the other end, the report found that Zimbabweans, with just US$200 (about N$2 600) per person, were the poorest in Africa.South Africans are the second wealthiest people in Africa with an average wealth per person of US$11 300 (about N$149 000) in 2016.Botswana comes fourth at US$6 700 (about N$88 400) per person.According to the researchers, they preferred to use wealth per capita rather than gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to determine wealth. For instance, GDP ignores the efficiency of the local banking sector and the local stock market at retaining wealth in a country.THE MILLIONAIRESWith a population of just over two million people, the reports says Namibia is home to 3 300 millionaires.
