Twenty one people have been prosecuted by a mobile court in Kuje during the monthly sanitation exercise on Saturday.The vice chairman of the council, Samuel T. Duda, who is the chairman of the seven-man sanitation committee, disclosed this to newsmen shortly after monitoring the level of compliance in the area.He said those that were prosecuted failed to comply with the sanitation law, adding that the 21 offenders were fined by the mobile court."As the chairman of the committee on monthly sanitation exercise in Kuje, I feel I should join the sanitary officers in order to ensure there is full compliance. And we thank God as the residents gave us their support, except the 21 who failed to comply and were prosecuted by a mobile court," he said.He said despite the little hitches experienced on the first day, the exercise was successful, and that it has come to stay.
