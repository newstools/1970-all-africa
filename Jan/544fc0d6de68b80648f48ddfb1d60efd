Following the quit notice issued Igbo by the Northern Youths Coliation Forum, (NYC), Mr. Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa, aka, 'Charly Boy' in a viral online video advised Bifran agitators who are angrily bent to have referendum, plebiscite and a separate country from Nigeria, to calm their temperament,return home and help in harnessing the key industrialized areas (Onitsha, Nnewi, Aba etc), in the South East.According to him, "Let it be well to all the Igbo listening to me. "I know that Nigeria has shattered, Biafra is on everyone's lip, please don't be angry for the injustice meted on us by Nigerians. 'Let's use our brains in this critical period. Please let's look inward on Biafran land, places like Aba, Nnewi and Onitsha. Lets help in harnessing these areas for tomorrow, thus to have a place to run to if we are chased out, he said.Furthering his advice, the area boy quizzed, " Talking about 'Biafra', who will lead us? Is it 419ners, (Fraudsters), criminals and saboteurs, no he forcefully abhorred. "I know all of us are angry but I said unto you today to calm down my people, whether they like it or not, in a due time our tension will be doused.'I want to use this opportunity to advice my fellow Igbo to calm down, 'onye ajuru adighi aju onweya' meaning 'rejected people do not reject themselves'. Let's use own brain, trade with caution and harness our place", he finally said.Do you agree with him? Type your comment bellow.
