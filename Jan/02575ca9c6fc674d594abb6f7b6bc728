Our people do not have an improved variety of rice, so we are distributing the Faro 4.4 and Faro 4.1. Both of them need water which is called the low farm rice. This rice is not for eating because it has been processed with chemicals which will last for a period of two years", she saidThe Speaker's wife, who said each 10kg of rice was expected to produce 10 to 12 bags of rice, added that the rice takes four months to yield.The Member representing Tafawa Balewa constituency in the State House of Assembly, Aminu Tukur who spoke on behalf of the beneficiaries thanked the wife of the speaker for empowering the lives of rural women, saying that the farm inputs would be used judiciously.
