Tharaka-Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa has said that he is not opposed to the building of the proposed Sh150 billion High Grand Falls Dam but wants adequate compensation for those to be affected.Speaking Sunday in Tharaka, Mr Ragwa said the national government has remained silent on the compensation package, raising concerns on the fate of those to be displaced."We want adequate compensation for our people so that they can settle elsewhere before the project starts," said Mr Ragwa.The governor said locals are only hearing through the media that work will soon start and they would like to know about compensation and where they will be relocated to."The locals are in total darkness on the progress of the plans and do not even know the exact area that will be covered by the dam," he said.He noted that the Tharaka people should be compensated at the same rates as those affected by the building of the standard gauge railway (SGR) or other government projects.He added that the government should also tell the locals how they will directly benefit from the project.However, the governor called on the residents to remain calm as local leaders engage the relevant government agencies.Recently, Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki also stated that no one will be moved from their land before being adequately compensated.The proposed dam is expected to displace thousands of people in Tharaka-Nithi, Embu and Kitui counties.
