An attack on an ambulance in Nyanga that left a paramedic injured is being investigated, Western Cape police said on Wednesday.Protesters stoned and damaged passing vehicles on Lansdowne Road, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said.Bricks were flung at the provincial health EMS vehicle just after noon on Tuesday, on the corner of Eisleben and Lansdowne Roads, said department spokesperson Robert Daniels."One of the bricks flung at the ambulance entered the cabin and hit the emergency medical practitioner in her back. The other crew member was left uninjured but traumatised."Daniels said the crew were removed from duty, received medical attention and were offered counselling.Nyanga was declared a red zone, which meant no EMS vehicle could enter the area without a police escort until 07:00.Source: News24
