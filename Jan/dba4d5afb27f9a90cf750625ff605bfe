Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has used an address at the opening of the first United Nations conference on oceans to call for an end to sanctions on his landlocked country so it can implement a series of global goals on sustainable development. "The effects of climate change are not discriminatory, so please down with your sanctions," Mugabe said.
