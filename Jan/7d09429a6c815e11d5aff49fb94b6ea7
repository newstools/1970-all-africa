Lagos &mdash; One of the major challenges being faced at the Lagos Computer Village, the largest Information and Communication Technology (ICT) hub in Africa, is the problem of phone theft, it was observed yesterday.President of Computer and Allied Products Dealers Association of Nigeria (CAPDAN), Comrade Ahmed Ojikutu, who disclosed this said the leadership of computer village is worried over issues arising from the sale of phones and other ICT dealings within the market.Ojikutu stated this during the launch of a phone theft prevention software in partnership with Fonreg.The new software hosted on www.fonreg.com.ng has been described as an innovative crime prevention strategy in the phone and allied products value chain.This is why the CAPDAN leadership forged a pact with Fonreg to introduce the platform which operates with the phone's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.Other stakeholders including the security agents and member of the House of Assembly for Ikeja 1, Fola Lai Mohammed, also graced the launch of the platform where they endorsed the new software."This software will help anybody to track a lost phone. If your phone is registered on fonreg and you go to that portal that your phone has been stolen, all you need to do is to check the information on the whereabouts of the phone," he said.According to him, lack of knowledge has led many dealers at computer village into trouble after buying a phone and reselling it.
