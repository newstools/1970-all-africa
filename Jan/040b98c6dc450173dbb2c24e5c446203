Nairobi &mdash; Musician Charles Njagua Kanyi, also known as Jaguar is the official Jubilee Party nominee for the Starehe constituency seat.Jaguar who challenged the declaration of incumbent MP Maina Kamanda as the winner of the primary conducted by the party was given the nomination certificate at the Jubilee headquarters by the Appeals Tribunal Chairperson Faith Waigwa, who said there was compelling evidence that his results were altered."The tribunal overturns the results as declared by the Returning Officer Starehe constituency declaring Maina Kamanda as the winner and declares Charles Njagua as the winner and hereby directs the National Elections Board to issue him with a nomination certificate," Waigwa said on Wednesday.In his acceptance speech, the musician said the ruling reflected the will of the people saying he was glad that he had finally been vindicated."There's no crying today. I am very happy because we have fought for the certificate. I want to thank the tribunal of the party for the fair hearing because that shows they have a space for the youths of this country," Jaguar said amid cheers by his supporters.The popular musician who over the weekend broke down into tears after allegedly being compelled to have dialogue with Kamanda thanked his voters for supporting him, while pledging to work diligently for them."The good thing is that the people of Starehe came out in large numbers early in the morning to vote for me. I want to assure them that I will not be compromised," he affirmed.On Thursday last week, Jubilee Party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta visited party headquarters at Pangani where a number of aspirants challenging the results of the primaries had pitched tent including Jaguar.
