Pius is just fresh from his longest professional tour to date, one that kicked off in Uganda in February, and wound up in Switzerland a month later:"In February we went to Uganda for a show with Charly &amp; Nina. From that show in Uganda we went straight to Central African Republic for a Valentine's Day gig and had two shows there, returned to Rwanda, after whichwe were supposed to go to Belgium but the deal was too soon for me so I didn't process my Visa fast enough."So I had to sit out that one and go straight to France after a week. I departed on March 1, and had a show there with Charly &amp; Nina, then another show in Switzerland."He returned briefly to Rwanda, but was soon back in France, prospecting for business."In France, I had a meeting with Trace TV. I met them and we discussed and they told me what they wanted me to do and I told them what they would do for me so it was kind of barter trade; my songs to play on Trace TV and for me to promote their events in East Africa as a DJ and promoter and even select music of prominent Rwandan artistes which can play on their TV station."He says we should expect a big announcement soon."We're trying to organise a show in Kigali and, if we do that, more details about the deal will come forth. But yes, it's there and we have some agreements already signed."
