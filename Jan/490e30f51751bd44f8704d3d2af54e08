We must invest in the youth in order to prepare them to be productive and responsible citizens who will spearhead the transformation of the continent," said Mohamed.Speaking in Addis Ababa where she represented President Kenyatta at the 29th Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly, the CS stressed the need for governments to build the skills of the youth and expand economic opportunities to cater for the youths joining the workforce.The Cabinet Secretary was contributing to the theme of the Summit: Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in the Youth."Harnessing the demographic dividend in Africa will pivot around governments' commitment to creating sufficient job opportunities to absorb the increasing number of emerging youthful workforce," said Mohamed"We must focus on both creating jobs for the youth as well as building their capacity with appropriate skills and attitudes that will enable them to make a positive contribution," added the CSThe Cabinet Secretary further called on African governments to close the gender gap in employment and leadership in order to realise the full potential of the continent's demographic dividend."To achieve greater demographic dividend, it is imperative that we encourage and support our young women and men to actively participate in political and electoral matters," said the Cabinet Secretary.Mohamed said Kenya is committed to investing in the youth and has already developed a National Demographic roadmap."Specifically, the roadmap has domesticated the African Union demographic dividend roadmap within the Kenyan context and highlighted priority actions that need to be undertaken by the country in each of the key demographic dividend sectors," said the CS."As a country, we are placing emphasis on the four pillars of the African Union roadmap namely, health and wellbeing, education and skills development, employment and entrepreneurship and rights, governance and youth empowerment," added Mohamed.The CS said Africa is projected to account for about 3.2 billion of the projected 4 billion increases in the global population by 2100, adding that the rising share of Africa's working age population is increasing the continent's productive potential at a time when most developed economies are facing the crisis of aging populations.
