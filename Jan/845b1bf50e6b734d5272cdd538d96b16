The Starboy singer has signed a multi-album worldwide deal with RCA Records/Sony Music International. Wizkid said, "It's hard for me to describe what I do, since I work with rhythms from Afro-Beat, reggae, hip-hop, dance hall and others... What's important to me is for music to be real, authentic, raw and timeless. I don't wanna be boxed in to any one genre."
