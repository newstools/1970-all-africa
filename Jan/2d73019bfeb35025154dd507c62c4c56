Nigeria is currently ranked 4th among the 22 high-burden Tuberculosis (TB) countries in the world, there is serious concern in health circles in the country. An estimated 586,000 TB cases occurred in Nigeria in 2016 with only about 100,434 (17 per cent) of cases being detected and notified by the National TB Programme.The undetected 83 per cent of TB cases serve as reservoir for continued transmission of the disease pathogen. According to the 2015 Global report of the World Health Organisation, WHO, the estimated TB incidence rate in Nigeria was put at 322/ 100,000 population with a prevalence rate of 330/ 100,000 population.TB-HIV interactionResearch shows that TB is synergistically affected by HIV. While HIV fuels the TB burden, TB is the commonest infection suffered by People Living with HIV (PLWHIV).Nigeria presently has between 3-4 million people living with HIV - the second highest HIV burden in the world. The TB/ HIV burden poses serious challenges to the Nigerian health sector and similar resource limited settings. About 40 per cent of deaths in PLWHIV has been linked to TB. In recent years, an estimated 1.2 million PLWHIV have died from complications arising from TB.Correct and prompt diagnosis of TB in this key group is crucial in the fight against HIV in Nigeria and worldwide. Presently, global efforts to fight TB and HIV require improved collaboration between programmes to ensure a holistic approach in dealing with the dual epidemic.Scale up of efforts: Nigeria needs to urgently upscale efforts in preventing, diagnosing and treating TB to ensure success in the fight against both diseases.Healthcare workers need to be aware of the close link between HIV and TB and always exclude co-infection when assessing patients presenting with symptoms compatible with either or both disease conditions. Patients who have TB require immediate testing for HIV and those found to be positive must be started on treatment for HIV. Also, persons diagnosed with HIV require screening for TB and a low threshold for clinical intervention.The Federal government is engaging closely with partners to ensure better collaboration at health facilities between TB and HIV programmes. Presently in many facilities, both programmes function in parallel with the result being increased patient attrition and the risk of further disease transmission in the community.Successes recorded with TB/HIV collaboration at the national level has not been adequately replicated at the state and facility level. One of such successes arising from such high level collaboration is the recent installation of 185 GeneXpert machines by the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) in collaboration with the National TB and Leprosy Control Programme and KNCV TB Foundation to improve the diagnosis of TB among PLHIV as well as other priority groups at risk of TB.Also, the success of the TB/HIV Technical Working Group currently co-chaired by the NTBLCP and the National HIV/AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCP), which incidentally are both organs of the Federal Ministry of Health has not been really replicated at the state level and even at the local/facility level.The result is the perceived lack of ownership and sustainability of both programmes at the state and local levels.With donor funding accounting for nearly 85-90 percent of funding for both programmes, an integrated approach at State and LGA levels should be adopted to ensure sustainability and enhance stronger collaboration.GeneXpert machine: The availability and utility of molecular diagnostics using the GeneXpert machine is crucial to the success of the TB programme in Nigeria. The GeneXpert machine is a cartridge based test which can diagnose TB and also define susceptibility to rifampicin, a marker of Multi-Drug Resistant TB.At present, Nigeria has over 300 GeneXpert machines spread across the country and donated by various donor groups and agencies. Unfortunately, many of these machines are grossly underutilised and some require major repairs at significant cost to the host facility.Warranty certificates from the company (Cepheid) also come at quite a cost. In the long term, a robust strategy is required to improve country ownership of TB diagnostics as well as innovative funding models to ensure the long term sustainability of the TB programme.Partnership: As the Federal Government partners with international donors to continue to deliver the bulk of the National TB Programme, State governments should be supported and encouraged to commit funds towards the sustainable maintenance of these machines in both the short and long term.The bottom line is that TB and HIV control programmes are intrinsically-linked and have many things in common. Therefore a collaborative effort backed by a coherent and robust approach at national and sub-national levels by government and partners will go a long way towards tacking the deadly twin scourge and ensuring a healthy TB- and HIV free generation.
