THE United Nations is worried at the ethnic clashes in central Sudan, where its workers have been caught in the crossfire. The conflict is most severe in the Abyei region, established in 2005 at the end of the second Sudan civil war. Armed elements from rival ethnic groups and the proliferation of illegal arms have been commonplace in recent months amid fights over territories. Ceasefire agreements reached in 2011 have not yielded results, bringing about the intervention of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). UN said despite enhanced security at critical road crossings armed assailants recently hijacked a World Health Organization-Sudan vehicle north of Diffra. Another carjacking attempt on contractors for the International Organisation for Migration travelling from Diffra towards Goli has resulted in the death of a contractor and the wounding of his driver. Following the attack, UNISFA has reinforced its procedures to ensure the safety of its staff and workers connected with its projects in Abyei Area. The Security Council said the timing of these incidents suggested the aim of the armed elements was to influence deliberations at the meetings of intercommunity traditional leaders held between December and January. - CAJ News
