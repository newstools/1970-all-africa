The government has set up a ministerial committee to probe the controversial return of Brian Molefe to power utility Eskom after he was thought to have resigned to take up a position as member of parliament. It has been said by the Minister of Public Enterprises Lynn Brown that Molefe had not resigned from Eskom but had actually applied for early retirement.
