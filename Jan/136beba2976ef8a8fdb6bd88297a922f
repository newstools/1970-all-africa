I am writing in response to opinion article titled MP Ssemujju should stop misleading Ugandans on Operation Wealth Creation by Lt General Charles Angina in the Daily Monitor of May 29, 2017.I salute Gen Angina for coming out to try to explain to Ugandans what the soldiers are doing in agricultural extension services. Gen Angina attempts to underline the successes of Operation Wealth Creation, but with no plausible evidence as the whole rural part of the country is wrecked by food insecurity, the epicenter being in Teso, where he hails from.Blaming food insecurity on purely drought sounds preliminary and simplistic, as though food insecurity began yesterday. In Teso sub-region, food insecurity has been a predominant phenomenon for the past 30 or so years. A decade or less ago, Prof Tarsis Kabwegyere, in trying to explore the root causes of food insecurity in Teso, was quoted in the press as blaming laziness and alcohol consumption. Of course he was wrong.Cyclical food insecurity in Teso is a product of interacting socioeconomic, political and geographical factors, beyond what Gen Angina is trying to say. On the geographical front, cattle that provided natural manure for the past 300 years or so was stolen under the watchful eye of government.This has generated deteriorating soil fertility and land degradation accompanied by low chemical fertilizer usage among the rural smallholder farmers, moreover amidst rising populations. The end result is low yields, high levels of food insecurity, famine and hunger, and the pattern continues.On policy dimension, prior to structural adjustment reforms, this region was one of the best agricultural areas in Uganda, with cotton as a major cash crop. With cotton production, the peasants in Teso sub-region earned income to educate children, afford medical services, meet basic household necessities, afford other non-farm products, maintain household investments and preserve food produce to attenuate geographical changes in some seasons. As such, cotton came to be referred to as the 'white gold'.However, with government's adoption of market policy reforms, embedded in the global neoliberal doctrine of market fundamentalism, the commodity marketing boards were dismantled.Gone are cooperatives and other institutions such as Lint Marketing Board that had insulated the peasants with the provision of inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, improved seeds, improved agricultural tools and extension advice), and outputs, especially marketing of the produce.Cotton production collapsed; with no substituting cash crop, the peasants turned to food crops as the new cash crops. Cassava, groundnuts, millet, peas and sorghum, which are basically the staple food crops in the sub-region, were turned into cash crops and taken to the market to meet basic necessities, household investment, school fees, and medical charges in private clinics as government hospitals long lost meaning.A combination of these features has created a tremendous negative bearing in terms of food security, with no practical policy options in sight for the wailing millions. Unfortunately, Gen Angina carefully leaves out such prominent factors in his arguments with Ssemujju.The restructuring of the National Agricultural Advisory Services program, which comprised the introduction of soldiers, remains contentious and laughable. It's not clearly known whether the Ugandan army has a strong agricultural component in its institutional framework to enable it to adequately carry out agricultural advisory services.Perhaps Gen Angina would do the country a favor by highlighting the strength of UPDF in agricultural extension service provision as opposed to talking about not being bribed because Ugandans have read UPDF ghosts scandal reports, junk choppers, undersized uniforms, etc.The phenomenon of food insecurity and poverty is more complex and complicated than just deploying gunmen to hunt it. These are just shock treatments; such approaches are never sustainable. It's incumbent upon the policy framers in Uganda to rethink of contextualized new policy prescriptions and reintroduce the cooperative movement and solve the underlying food insecurity challenges wrecking Teso and other parts of the country.Left alone to the impulses of geography and the market, peasants are an equivalence of consigning a fox to guard a chicken house, and then later we wonder.The author is a PhD scholar on poverty and policy.
