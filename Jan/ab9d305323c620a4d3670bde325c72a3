So, we are going to discuss with the Chinese embassy on how they can support us," he said.Dr Naano said another strategy they are planning to use is start talsk with social security funds so that they would start factories in the district.Reacing, some residents said it was time to implement instead of making empty promises.Mr Fazel Janja said an industrial economy was the solution to economic challenges facing residents of Musoma.He advised the government to ensure taht all running industries like fish processing plants, textile mills and diary milk processing units should be allowed to flourish.He suggested that there was no need for government to rush to open new industries instead it has to look for investors who will support the reopening of the industries that were closed due to different factors.
