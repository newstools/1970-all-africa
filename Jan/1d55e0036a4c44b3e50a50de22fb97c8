Of late, there has been great interest among the general public on not only health related data but also in other aspects in general.It is increasingly becoming common to hear statements such as "Can you provide evidence with data," among the public. This happens quite often when discussions are ongoing.Arguments which are backed up by some sort of numbers stand a better chance of being accepted as compared to simply, the logical ones.Certainly, this is a good direction. The world we are now living in has moved beyond making decisions based on good opinion. Rather, good evidence is key.Data indeed forms part of such evidence. For example it makes much more sense to say; "there has been an average of 75 per cent reduction in malaria disease and death between 2004 and 2009" as opposed to simply saying, "malaria is going down."The increase in the demand for evidence and data has resulted into a growing source of data such that it needs a second step to really determine what constitutes good data.Evidence and data in healthcare is relevant for planning and decision making.The nature of our healthcare system provides room for continuous generation of data--and more improvement in data collection.For instance, let's talk about hospital data which is collected from both inpatients and outpatients.This, if well planned, could be used as a very good source of evidence for decision-making and planning.In terms of clinical decisions, clinicians need to base their decisions on best available and accepted evidence which more often than not comes from research.This is particular to what we call the randomised controlled trials.But also, case reports and series might save as good experiences and source of information on best practices.The biggest challenge remains among the public on what constitutes good evidence.Increase in the use and availability of internet has exposed people to a lot of information to the public such that it has even become confusing.For example, the public is exposed to a lot of data on nutrition.But when interpreting and trying to base individual or even public decision on data on nutrition studies, it is important to consider so many factors.First and foremost is the population, type of food, soil from which such foods were grown and so on.This itself still leaves big questions on what constitutes good data and evidence. For individuals, the traditional advice prevails, "Always discuss with the experts."The growing thirst for data and good evidence must go along with support for research, which generates such evidences.Decision which has been made based on evidence stands for better chance of becoming effective as opposed to brilliant opinion which has not been tested.As this keeps growing far and beyond, the healthcare system needs to streamline what constitutes good evidence and this cannot be overemphasised.
