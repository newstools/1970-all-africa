It took long and I couldn't answer any more questions in class, school became hard for me, fellow students laughed at me, sometimes talked behind my back; it was a horrible experience but wouldn't allow all the two years to die for nothing so I hanged in there," she said in her previous interviews.When she went for a serious medical checkup with the help of a relative that was when she found out she had cancer. After getting chemotherapy, radiotherapy and several surgeries for the throat cancer, Ms Atuhirwe said she was screened and doctors at Mulago hospital, where she had been staying for more than a year, found out she had lung cancer as well.In April last year, the public contributed about Shs32.2m in a car wash to facilitate treatment for her in India, possibly her last shot to life. An ailing Carol during the fundraising event broke down in disbelief while her mother thanked the well-wishers for giving her another chance at life.CAROL'S MESSAGE TO WELL WISHERS AFTER THE FUNDRAISING"Hey sweet peopleI have taken hours trying to fit the right words to express my feelings but I failedYou have made me feel like the most important person on earth today.I swear I had never seen this.The word thank you is so ordinary but I will never stop saying it to you people as I wish for a better way to thank you.You're darlings but most of all you're my strength.May God keep you alive and livelyAnd happy all the time.You woke up from your beds (last Saturday) and gave me 57.9million shillings at the car wash in one day and left me asking myself really who I am?This has been a challenging time, and I appreciate you so much.""You have no idea how much your help has meant.""For all the little and big ways you've pitched in... thanks!""There was nothing random about your acts of kindness.
