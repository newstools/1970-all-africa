Painter Annabelle Reeno says she finds artistic inspiration from nature, family and African culture."I consistently express these feelings and creative energy on canvas," she said.Her medium to large acrylics on canvas are on display at an exhibition called World of Colour showing at the Nairobi National Museum until April 16. Reeno creates colourful, semi-abstract narrative illustrations often painted on blue backgrounds with shades of green, red and yellow. Her forms are typically outlined in thick black lines, and the faces are often in profile with heavy features.In Under Ocean Divers, a deep-sea diver embraces various fish and seahorses swimming through flowers. Reeno reflects on her time diving off the South Coast of Kenya."I saw the beauty of the deep and I tried to express that wonderful world on canvas," she explains.The different sea creatures have similar colours, and the fish have human-like eyes with eyelashes suggesting a connection between living things despite outward differences.The family unit is another favourite art topic for Reeno, who is a grandmother. The Loving Family is a portrait of large family, clasping each other tightly. "Each person needs the other in search for sustenance in life," says Reeno, adding that the cohesiveness of the family unit is the strength of a nation.Some of the other paintings are themed on romantic love. The couple in The Love Birds are caught in a passionate embrace.The exhibition has some works from her long running series called Love Gardens.They depict a dense assortment of brightly-coloured flowers, with birds, animals and human faces hidden amongst them. Reeno says that the series summarises her marriage and love for her husband."We live in a garden of love with my best friend," she says.Reeno grew up in central Kenya but currently lives in Uganda where she works with the church while pursuing her art.She started painting while in primary school, and has been a professional artist since the 1980s.
