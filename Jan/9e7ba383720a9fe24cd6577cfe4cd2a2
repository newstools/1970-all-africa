Lutherans from around the world are meeting in the Namibian capital Windhoek for the 12th Assembly of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). About 800 particpants are commemorating the 500 years since Martin Luther issued NinetyFive Theses critiquing the Roman Cathloic Church, a protest that led to the 'Reformation' and the emergence of Protestant denominations.A majority of Namibians belong to the three Lutheran churches in the country. The Reformation commemoration sermon will be delivered by Bishop emeritus Dr. Zephania Kameeta, a former LWF vice president who is currently heading Namibia's poverty eradication ministry.&nbsp;
