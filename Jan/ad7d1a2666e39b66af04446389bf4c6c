Organisers of the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) say they are unfazed by the wave of negative criticism that they have received following the release of the nominees list.The inaugural awards, meant to celebrate and honour personalities from the country's cradle of the arts, Bulawayo, will be held on June 30 at the Large City Hall.While many people have endorsed the awards, some have been critical with the organisers having to defend the initiative.The chorus of disapproval was amplified this week following the release of the nominees list on Saturday.Raisedon Baya, who is involved in the initiative, told NewZimbabwe.com that most of the criticism they are getting is "petty"."We have artists that thought they would make the list-artists who did not even submit anything throwing tantrums on social media just to get a few likes and retweets. If you believe you are good, submit your works. It is that simple."But also in life our artists need to know that judging art is not a scientific process. It is about tastes, impression, values. There is always a possibility that what you think is best, might not necessarily be the best, For BAA it is always about recognising effort and talent," he said.However, Baya said the response from the arts community has been overwhelming."We had over 400 entries," he said, adding, "For the first time. It is very encouraging. We should not forget that because of the economic challenges many artists were not very productive in 2016."The challenge, Baya said, was choosing the best from the entries."Firstly, the quality and standards of entries were a mixed bag, making it difficult for us to pick the top three. Secondly, most artists, especially in music, were not sure about their genres. Thirdly, some were just entering any category," he said.Baya said they were grateful for the support they were getting from corporates and individuals."The corporates are coming in slowly, but for BAA I think the biggest surprise and endorsement has been the individuals who are coming in with financial support. They have been amazing. While we still need corporate support we have also realised our people are with us, and are prepared to support with the little they have," said Baya.Full list on Bulawayo Arts Awards nominees:Below is the full nominees list:Outstanding Visual ArtistIsrael Israel: Bhekitshe Ntshali: Enock ChimbeteteOutstanding Literary WorkMarshal Chiza: Philani A NyoniOutstanding Online MediaOnvi TV : Fokus Magazine : Urban CulxureOutstanding Media HouseThe Chronicle : Skyz Metro FM : Sunday NewsOutstanding Arts JournalistSindiso Dube (Newsday) : Bruce Ndlove (B Metro) : Bongani Ndlovu (The Chronicle)Outstanding Video DirectorVusa Blaqs : Andy Cuta : Tswarelo MothobeOutstanding PoetLikhwa oka Ncube : Desire Moyoxide : Tinashe TafirenyikaOutstanding Arts PhotographerK.B Mpofu : Josh Webster : Mgcini NyoniOutstanding Theatre ActressNomvuyiso Mabi (Double Funeral) : Tsitsi Gumbo (Untikolotshi) : Lady Tshawe (Kosha &amp; The Drifter)Outstanding Theatre ActorFortune Ruzungunde (Untikolotshi) : Gift Chakuvinga (Double Funeral) : Janco Van Der Weisterzen (Joseph and Coat of Many Colours)Outstanding Theatre ProductionJoseph and Coat of Many Colours (Bulawayo Theatre): Warrior (Umkhathi Theatre Works) : Untikolotshi ( Theatre for Everyone)Outstanding Film ActressDonna N (The Lost Letter): Nondumo C Ngwenya (Skhobokhobo : Power Jeki) : Gamuchirai Chenenga (In Between)Outstanding Film ActorExult Ncube (The Lost Letter): Madlela (Skhobokhobo 2): Daniel LeskerOutstanding FilmThe Way It Is: The Arthur Evans Show: Thatha Wena: The Lost LetterOutstanding ComedianNtando Van Moyo: Carl Joshua Ncube: Oliver Keith: Clive ChigubhuOutstanding Traditional Dance EnsembleEzimnyama Dance Ensemble: Umkhathi Theatre Works: Sekunjalo Ma AfricaOutstanding Contemporary Dance EnsembleSnipers Dance CrewIYASAExplosion Dance CrewOutstanding Male DancerMbongeni Nxumalo (IYASA): Dereck Thembo (Kaisa): Masotha Nzou (Sungura Masters)Outstanding Female DancerCheryl Mabaya (IYASA): Dadirai Mpandawana (Ezimnyama Dance Ensemble) : Zanele Maseko (Hloseni Arts)Outstanding DesignerAra Kani : Brandroom Exclusive : Shadow by SidumisoOutstanding ModelMiyamiko Banda : Ashley Morgen : Shadel NobleOutstanding Imbube Group/ActFamily Voices : Nobuntu : Impumelelo Shining StarsOutstanding Kwaito/HouseSkaiva : Mncedisi Moyo (Byo Knights) : Shirati : SinazoOutstanding Gospel ArtistVocal X : Willis Wataffi : Lorraine Maplanka Stot : Eric MoyoOutstanding Tshibilika/RhumbaMadlela Sikhobokhobo : Martin Sibanda and Ndolwane Super Sounds : Clement MagwazaOutstanding Alternative MusicMzoe 7 : Hwabaraty : Jeys Marabini : Sandra NdebeleOutstanding Ambassador Based in South AfricaBerita Khumalo : Ernest Phosa Ndlovu : OskidoOutstanding Ambassador Rest of WorldBlack Umfolosi : Mokoomba : InsingiziOutstanding New Comer of the YearMadlela Skhobokhobo : Donna N : Bkay &amp; TKP (Ziya Vaya Show; Skyz Metro FM)Outstanding DJ of the YearRyan Synth : DJ Liz : DJ PhathisaniOutstanding Hip Hop ArtistAWA-Khiwe : CAL-VIN : That Boy ASAPHSong of the YearIngoma (Sandra Ndebele ft Mzoe 7) : Ngamnanka uSaMamoe (Madlela Skhobokhobo) : Kalanga Child (Sinazo ft DJ Dash) : Ngiyakukhumbula (Misizi Kay) : Zanaleli (Ras Boom and DJ Ace Kater)Outstanding Male Artist of the YearMzoe 7: Vusa Mkhaya: CAL-VIN : Jeys Marabini : Ramsey KOutstanding Female Artist of the YearAWA-Khiwe: Kadder : Nkwali : Lorrain Maplanka Stot : Sandra NdebeleOutstanding Actor (Schools)Sailas Matsika (Gifford High School): Wisdom Mpofu (Mzilikazi High School): Nobert Makoche (Gifford High School)Outstanding Actress (Schools)Linet Cheure (Nketa High School): Anita Moyo (Eveline High School) : Panashe Jima (Mzilikazi High School)Outstanding Arts EducatorBridget Sayers (Gifford High School): Sandisiwe Bhebhe (Mzilikazi High School): Thabani H.
