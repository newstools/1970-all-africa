Singapore &mdash; Contact center solution vendors should push their services to gain market share, finds Frost &amp; Sullivan's Digital Transformation teamThe emergence of enhanced customer experience (CX), replacement of legacy systems, upgrade of existing solution portfolios, and increasing focus on the optimization of contact center operations are factors driving growth in the Asia-Pacific contact center application market. To gain a competitive advantage and market share, contact center solution vendors should actively roll out and push their cloud contact center services in alliance with global and regional telecommunication companies."Avaya, Genesys, Verint Systems, NICE Systems, and Cisco strategically offer omnichannel customer experience (CX) to attract business across end-user segments," said Frost &amp; Sullivan Digital Transformation Industry Analyst Shuishan Lu. "A richer CX is a significant differentiator.
