The Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers (HIRD), a movement driven by young graduates on national service has afforded people in rural areas opportunity to access healthcare services at their doorsteps.The initiative which was launched by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) last year organizes outreaches in rural areas and urban slums where residents are screened for diseases, administered drugs and counselled.President of HIRD in Karshi area of the Federal Capital Territory and a serving corp member under Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) Dr Hope Abraham said health seeking behaviour in the area was generally poor."We don't just give drugs, we give health talks. That again will improve their health seeking behavior. Even among health care providers, health seeking behaviour is poor," said Abraham.The medical outreaches involves collaboration with different partners who provide personnel to screen, educate, test and give medicines to residents of randomly chosen rural communities.Abraham said that defined the essence of primary health care as a partnership with community residents and their leaders."For the people we see, they are benefitting as they access health care. For us, we are just serving humanity. That's the opportunity for us," said Abraham.At the recent HIRD outreach, more than 150 residents turned out for consultation within hours.
