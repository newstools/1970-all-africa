The leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, has said that IPOB did not give any deadline for the actualization of the sovereign state of Biafra and neither did he say there would be no election without a referendum on Biafra, but government is using media to spread false information about him and the agitation for Biafra.The IPOB leader said it was the people of Biafra who said they did not want the November 18, 2017 election in Anambra State and not himself.This is even as the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, yesterday, insisted that the South-East governors and the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo cannot decide for the over 50 million Igbo in the country on issues affecting the collective interest of the people.Kanu told Sahara Reporters in an interview that the people in power were employing all means to make him lose the support of his people.He said: "The media has an interest in maintaining one Nigeria with those that loot, steal and cheat in the political landscape. The more Nigeria continues, the more these criminals and rogues get fatter."All those spreading nonsense about Nnamdi Kanu know that Nnamdi Kanu is the only person capable of articulating a policy that can get people out of the mess that we are in. The government wants us to remain poor, they know what they are saying is false but they continue to say so."He also advised Biafrans and Nigerians to disregard any form of false information being shared by the government. He, however, stated that he is in no position to determine how people consume information.The IPOB leader challenged the people to question the government on main issues affecting the country.He said: "People should be more concerned with the gross abuse of human rights being perpetrated by DSS, Police, and Army. They should ask questions on amnesty report, the mass grave in army barracks in Onitsha, bad roads across the country despite the resources allocated to their maintenance and unemployed graduates."Kanu reiterated that nothing can make them reverse on their decision from breaking away from Nigeria.He said: "There is absolutely nothing anybody can do. We have crossed the point of no return and there is nothing anybody can do. If I am alive or dead, wherever I may be, Biafra will come. If I die, it will be better because it will even make it come quicker."Kanu never said Anambra election won't hold --IPOB"The boycott of election in Anambra State, come November this year, was not the making of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu but rather the wish of the people of the Eastern Nigeria and IPOB members, who visited him in his home town, Umuahia, where the people told him that they did not need elections again in Biafra land and were ready to boycott such elections because since the creation of Nigeria, they had benefited nothing from Nigeria's elections except killings, riots and humiliation from politicians."Stop comparing me with God--KanuSpokesman of IPOB, Emma Powerful, who made this known in a statement, yesterday, alleged that security agencies have perfected plans to disparage its leader by accusing him of allegedly playing God, in a bid to cause misunderstanding and confusion between the IPOB leader and Christians in Biafra land. According to Emma Powerful, "the enemies of Biafra were allegedly portraying the members of IPOB, under the leadership of Kanu, of also challenging the authority of God."Mazi Kanu in his life time, had never challenged the authority of God Almighty who created heaven and earth or Jesus Christ, the son of God or the Holy Spirit."It is very pathetic that the enemies of Biafra, IPOB and Kanu will use his name on Facebook handles as well as other social media platforms to cause disunity among the people of God and the Christian faithful."Nnamdi Kanu is a Christian and cannot blaspheme God and his son, Jesus Christ. Those using his name as saviour, messiah and Jesus are misinformed and uneducated because he never asked them to do so."Since the announcement for the election boycott in Anambra State, the Federal Government and their agents, including the DSS, have mapped out strategies and huge amount of money to destroy and tarnish Kanu's image and IPOB in general. Those with this stupid story on social media platforms should retrace their steps because they will fail."Nnamdi Kanu had warned everybody to stop using his name or comparing him with God Almighty. Nobody can prove that he had ever wanted people to compare himself with Jesus Christ either through the video or voice call. Anybody who has such video or film should show it."It is dangerous to compare him with God Almighty or Jesus Christ. It is the work of enemies planted within us by security agents and some politicians."Those involved in this ridiculous scandal and defamation of character will fail without further delay and God Almighty, or Chukwu Okike Abiama must deal with them."Therefore, we call on Biafrans, clergymen and women, church leaders and Christians to disregard the allegations as they amount to the works of evil people who do not want to see good things coming to our people."S'East govs, Ohanaeze can't decide for us --MASSOBIn a statement in Abakaliki, Director of Information of MASSOB, Comrade Edeson Samuel, who said the group would not accept any move geared towards the restructuring of the country, stressed that it is either Biafra or nothing else.The statement read in part: "MASSOB rejects totally the decision taken by South-East governors and the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in their meeting last week, in which they said they will remain in Nigeria.'It is a shameful, disgraceful, abomination and act of sabotage for the governors and Ohanaeze Ndigbo to take such dangerous decision for over 50 million Ndigbo and Biafrans without their consent."These so-called leaders want to mortgage the destinies and future of these young generations because of their interest and greed. These South-East governors and the Ohanaeze leadership want to play good boy in the hands of their political masters who use them as tools against the wish and desire of Ndigbo and Biafrans."Our so-called leaders have never called a meeting of various groups where every group will contribute ideas in respect of the quit notice served Ndigbo by Arewa youths."Our brothers from South-West, the Afenifere and other groups like OPC in South West are busy organising themselves, the ACF and their youth wing have been holding secret meetings, but our so-called leaders are busy making much noise in the media."Massob will no longer accommodate these Abuja politicians that have no political values in Igbo land. Massob will not accept restructuring or 2014 National conference. It's Biafra or nothing."
