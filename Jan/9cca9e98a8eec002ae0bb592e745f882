The travelers you find in this picture are surely not vacationers or pilgrims. They are neither transporters nor ordinary residents of the Toko municipality. They surely come from distant lands, certainly for business or conservation motives. In fact, the Toko municipality may soon run out of living space due to pressure from organizations interested in pulp business. The council area has a total surface area of 103,413 hectares, representing a population density of fifteen to thirty inhabitants per km2, according to the South West Master Plan, 2004. This low population density is caused by the extended dense tropical forests, most of which are reserved. The Korup National Park, the Rumpi Forest and Christian Philanthropic Forest projects have already reserved chunks of these forests. Indigenes say an organization from the United States known as SG SOC has recently planted an oil palm nursery in Lipenja and is requesting 13,303 hectares of land. They fear that if the request is granted, these organizations will have control of more than 70% of the entire surface area of Toko municipality while the community will be left with about 30% of land to farm and hunt. The forest is endowed with rich natural resources, including stones, rocks, sand deposits, timber and wildlife.
