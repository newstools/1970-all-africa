Senators and members of the House of Representatives have clashed over planned visits to South Africa to engage that country's officials over the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians.Daily Trust gathered that the clash occurred as the two chambers failed to reach an agreement on a single delegation of the National Assembly to visit South Africa.The House had on February 22 passed a resolution condemning the attacks and mandated a delegation headed by majority leader, Femi Gbajabiamila to meet with members of the South African parliament and other government officials in that country.On February 28, the Senate also passed similar resolution to send its delegation led by Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu to South Africa for the same purpose.It was gathered that in order to find a middle ground on the matter, leaders of the two chambers met Tuesday night where senators suggested that the two chambers should send a single delegation.However, the House reportedly rejected the idea, insisting that its delegation would proceed on the planned visit alone.Gbajabiamila had while responding to questions during a press briefing on Tuesday said the planned visit by the Senate was unnecessary as the House passed its resolution long before the Senate.The clash forced Senate to cancel its planned visit to South Africa as announced by Ekweremadu during plenary yesterday after a closed-door session.
