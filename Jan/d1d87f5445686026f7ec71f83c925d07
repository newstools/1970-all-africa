A FAO news release titled "Multi-pronged approach key for effectively defeating fall armyworm in Africa" has indicated that solutions to the problem include development of pest-resistant, drought tolerant and disease resistant hybrid crops that are more resilient to the fall armyworm, the use of bio-pesticides, pheromone traps and low-cost chemical pesticides. The article also suggests the use of genetic modification (GM) to build host plant resistance to the pest as well as identification of predatory insects and birds.The news release, dated May 1, 2017, says that among options explored by various governments is to provide emergency pesticides to smallholder farmers but it warns that this costly option can deliver only mixed success due to plant resistance to the chemicals used as well as their poor application by farmers.The news release also reveals that the pest attacks 80 different plant species including maize on which more than 200 million people depend for food. It adds that fighting it will require quick and coordinated action, a massive awareness campaign, scientific innovation and multi-institutional collaboration. It gives a conservative estimate of Africa's loss due to the fall armyworm as $3 billion in the coming year alone.According to Dr Rogers Day of the Centre for Agricultural and Biosciences International (CABI), "The female fall armyworm can lay up to 1,000 eggs at a time and can produce multiple generations very quickly without pause in tropical environments," says the release.The pest has been reported to have arrived in nearly all African countries south of the Sahara except Lesotho and the island states save for Sao Tome Principe where it exists.Cold winter temperatures halt its proliferation and this could explain why it has not been reported in Lesotho, which experiences colder winters than other mainland countries in Southern Africa.The news release goes on to point out that scientists believe the fall armyworm may have spread and proliferated on the continent due to warmer global temperatures and suspect the pests may have travelled from the Americas in warm ocean jet streams or arrived by some other form of transportation.
