The Senate yesterday directed the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service, Col Hameed Ali (retd), to appear "unfailingly" in his "appropriate" uniform on Wednesday March 14, 2017 following his refusal to suspend the plan against vehicles without duty paymentThe Senate resolved to summon Ali after Dino Melaye (APC - Kogi) had raised a motion calling the attention of his colleagues to the refusal of the Customs to suspend its action against owners of vehicles not duly registered with the service.The upper chamber had on Tuesday asked the Customs, NCS, to halt the action; but Mr. Melaye presented a report by The Sun newspapers uesterday, reporting Mr. Ali to have insisted that the NCS has its own rules which allow the planned clamp down.The senate's summon followed the support of some Melaye's colleagues , including Kabiru Marafa (APC-Zamfara), Emmanuel Bwacha (PDP-Taraba), Aliyu Wamako (APC-Sokoto), and Solomon Olamilekan (APC-Lagos), asking Ali, a retired army colonel who has refused to wear the customs uniform, appear before the Senate. Consequently, the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who presided yesterday, gave the ruling.This was just as Lanre Tejuoso (APC-Ogun) claimed Customs operatives "killed two persons" in his constituency, adding "we must look into the activities of the Customs."The lawmakers said disregard for Senate resolutions meant "indirect disrespect to the nation and the President"; and that such impunity must be fought along with corruption.Meanwhile, the Senate Leader, Ahmed Lawan, cautioned his colleagues against acting on newspaper report, adding that the Senate must be respected and any official summoned must appear "within the stimulated time."
