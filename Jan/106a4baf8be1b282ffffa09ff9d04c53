Kaduna &mdash; An elder statesman, Senator Walid Jibrin, yesterday regarded the declaration as an invitation for another civil war, labelling those behind the motive as kids who have never experienced such an animosity.Jibrin, who is the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees, however reminded the youths that the people they set to chase out have been playing vital role in developing the region's economy.He urged northern traditional rulers and elders to call the youths to order.His words: "The Igbo are very broad-minded people who have helped to develop the economy of the north. There is no village, ward or town where you will not find an Igbo person living peacefully with the people. The South East people have always remained the allies of the north since independence."Therefore, any action that will lead Nigeria to a civil war should never be entertained especially now that Nigeria needs unity from everyone."The agitation for Biafra by some Igbo is not enough to abandon all northern Igbo. I have noted with admiration the action of some Igbo leaders, including their governors, who are seriously against the creation of Biafra and would prefer Nigeria to remain as one entity."
