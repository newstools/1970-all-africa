President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, known popularly as Farmajo, has said that the longstanding embargo on his country "severely restricts" his troops' ability to fight Al-Shabaab. "Our security forces and terrorist groups have been fighting using the same type of light weapons - mostly AK47s," he told attendees of the London Summit on Somalia.
