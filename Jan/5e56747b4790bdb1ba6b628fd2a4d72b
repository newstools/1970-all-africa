The month of May 2017 registered the death of three distinguished Ugandans whose circumstances of death define Uganda's current gender inequality status.Events following the death of Thomas Opira (the former Pader resident district commissioner), Gulu municipal assistant town clerk John Oola Omona and Ivan Ssemwanga (Zari Hassan's ex-husband and philanthropist) defined the real status of women in our society.While addressing mourners at the funeral of Omona, Gulu municipal town clerk Francis Barahamame emphasized that all condolence contributions from the municipality would be handed directly to the widow, to the shock of many family elders.Similarly, Catherine Lamwaka, who was still legally married to Thomas Opira, is alleged to have been unable to attend the burial of her husband since she had fallen out with relatives of Opira for serving him divorce papers and eloping with another man.In a similar manner, Zarina Hassan (Zari) disagreed with relatives of the late Ssemwanga over interests in his wealth since she had already separated with him and was now engaged to another man.This reflects a common case of gender inequality and lack of freedom. One would wonder why the Gulu municipal town clerk would choose to offer condolence contributions directly to the widow instead of the person identified by the family to be in charge of finances.Why is Lamwaka not free like Zari to have the chance to be involved in the burial of a man she loved and is married to despite their misunderstanding?Why would relatives of Ssemwanga challenge Zari for custody of her children?This is because of gender inequality and the violation of women's freedom of choice and economic rights. In 1995, Uganda adopted a Constitution which protected a wide range of human rights, including women's rights, to equality and freedom from discrimination. Article 33(6) of the Constitution prohibited "laws, customs or traditions which are against the dignity, welfare or interest of women".The Constitution sets the minimum age for marriage at 18 and specifies that "men and women are entitled to equal rights in marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution" (Article 31).In Uganda, statutory law is applied alongside customary and religious laws. Despite the provisions of the Constitution, discriminatory statutory, customary and religious laws remain in force, in particular in the areas of family law and property law.For instance, in 2007, the Constitutional court declared a provision of the Penal Code Act concerning the crime of adultery as unconstitutional. The provision makes it lawful for a married man to have an affair with an unmarried woman but unlawful for a married woman to have an affair with an unmarried man.Despite existing legislation, legal provisions and gender responsive policies and discrimination against women and girls remains an obstacle to the realization of rights and dignity of women in Uganda.In this circumstance, I believe Lamwaka should have been granted the same rights as any other person to choose who to be married to. Widows don't need the courage of mourners such as Barahamame to secure their economic rights.Neither should mothers such as Zari be challenged whether they have custody of their children even before the father of her children is buried. As Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche, in her book We Should All Be Feminists writes, "Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we can and must make it our culture."The responsibility for eliminating laws that discriminates against women is shared by the Ugandan Law Reform Commission (ULRC), parliament and the executive branch of government.Therefore, these three must eliminate the remaining discriminatory legislation and adopt laws to increase protection of women's rights. Discriminatory laws, including the Succession Act, must be reformed.We must also strengthen efforts to eliminate harmful practices and stereotypes that discriminate against women by implementing all relevant decisions of the Constitutional court on succession, and divorce without delay.Robust human rights remain elusive for most African women primarily because neither the international community nor national leaders have given primacy to the voices of African women themselves.Transcending the rhetoric of rights starts with recognizing the agency of African women and following the agenda they set. Listening to their priorities for the future of human rights work in the region can ensure that international human rights norms have sufficient legitimacy within particular cultures and traditions to prove effective.The author is an opinion leader based in Gulu.
