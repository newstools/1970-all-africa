United Bank for Africa&nbsp;Plc&nbsp;(UBA) successfully raised USD500 million,&nbsp;though&nbsp;a debut Eurobond, which was 240% over-subscribed. The significant investor demand reflects the strong global investor appetite for UBA's credit&nbsp;and support for the Group's pan-African financial services strategy. The Global Offering is a five-year senior unsecured benchmark bond (144A/Reg S) listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and will&nbsp;further support the Group's strategic vision, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;grow its franchise across&nbsp;the continent and client segments.The bond, which is rated by both Fitch (B, stable outlook) and S&amp;P (B, stable outlook), matures in June 2022 and was issued with a coupon rate of 7.75%, priced at an effective yield of 7.875%.&nbsp;This pricing is seen by the global investor community as the best possible pricing for a debut issue from a financial institution of Nigerian origin in current markets. The pricing&nbsp;was&nbsp;at par&nbsp;to&nbsp;the recent bond issue by the&nbsp;Federal Republic of Nigeria, which issued USD1 billion in February 2017.Investor interest was global, including the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, the Middle East&nbsp;and the US.Speaking on the offering, the Group Managing Director/CEO of UBA Plc, Mr. Kennedy&nbsp;Uzoka stated: "This successful dollar-denominated offering further illustrates&nbsp;global investor confidence in the strong fundamentals of our&nbsp;Group.
