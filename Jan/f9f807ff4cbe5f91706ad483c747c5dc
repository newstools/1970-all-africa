I think that in order for you to do that you need to have a very strong understanding of your purpose..." Hyde said in a statement.Per the statement, Hyde will join Editor of Forbes Woman Africa, Methil Renuka, in the premiere episode to discuss the vision behind the series."Why only talk about the glass ceiling when you have ceiling-crashers who have done it all and can show the way. They may be very few, but they have had significant successes and a discerning show like this will be lessons from those who made it, to those who would like to scale those same heights and more, very much in line with Forbes Woman Africa's own rich content philosophy," Renuka said in a statement.Forbes Woman Africa announced that they have teamed up with Ecobank to launch the 12-part series, which will also be available later this year to viewers on Canal Plus Channel 171, DStv Channel 410 and StarTimes Channel 309.
