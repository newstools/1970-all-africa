Women from the fifteen political-sub divisions have begun a three day capacity building training organized by Liberia National Rural Women Structure at the Young Women Christian Association (YWCA) in Congo Town.The capacity building training, which is being backed by the UN Women and Kvinna till Kvinnais, is aimed at highlighting the essence of female leadership in the country.During the three days training, women from around the country will learn the essence of making good decisions in order to choose their leaders as the election date draws closer. Good moral conduct, good communication skills among other skill sets will be taught.Giving the opening address, the national Chairlady of the Liberia National Rural Women Structure, Madam Kebeh Monger, told her fellow women that they can only go forward when they hold together."If all of us hold together, we can do great things. The small, small talking will divide us," she noted.The Liberia National Rural Women Structure was established in 2008. Since then, Madam Monger said they, as women of Liberia, have gotten many ideas from the leadership of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.As the country goes for election she cautioned her fellow women that the next leader needs to be assessed properly for the country to go forward."So the place where we are now in Liberia, we got some ideas from our madam, but we're not sure where we are going; so we got to think. Do you want to go back to the place where we were?""But as we move in front, we got to put the people under the microscope; because it is for our good and our children's good.""If we put the wrong person there we will suffer it, if we put the right person there it will get better. I am not talking politics ooh; I am talking the things that hurting us as women."She praise the women for coming from their various counties to talk about leadership and urged them to hold together to move the country forward."Our children depending on us, without us our children will be left behind.The problems still plenty, we still have rape, we still get gender based violent, we still get domestic violence, and we still get plenty problems so we cannot leaves it like this.So as we learn the leadership skills the next three days, when you go back call the other women who were not here, pass whatever you learn from here."Also speaking, the Program Associate of UN Women Moses Kelleh praised the rural women for the steadfastness since 2008.He added that they at the gender entity of the UN organization have strived to make sure the things that make women part of development are cardinal."We will make sure that gender base violence is something that is not existent. We will make sure those women empowerments is key in addressing some of the ills that we experience," Kelleh said.He said: "So, to partner with the rural women structure is something that the National Women Structure and the UN Women had been holding in their hearts."
