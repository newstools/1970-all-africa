The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) yesterday said it had acquired new platforms and was currently reactivating the existing ones to combat security challenges.Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, stated this in Lagos during the inauguration of newly-built Air Force Secondary School and Airmen Transit Accommodation at 401 Communications Depot, Shasha.Abubakar said the in-country reactivation of NAF's aircraft was one of the gains of the Force capacity-building, adding that six reactivated Alpha Jet engines were already being flown.He said: "Just recently, we reactivated six engines of Alpha Jets that would have been taken outside the country. Those six engines have been mounted on the aircraft and they are flying. That clearly shows our personnel are working hard."
