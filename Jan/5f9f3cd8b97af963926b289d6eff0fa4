Kampala &mdash; Insurers have said the sector has more than enough capacity to take on government assets in case it heeds to their appeal made last month."Yes, we do have the capacity to underwrite those assets because what happens is that the whole market pools their resources which is addressed as capacity to make sure that they can undertake that risk. We also work with external markets to make sure the risk is appropriately covered as well as managed," Uganda Insurers Association (UIA) chief executive officer Miriam Magala, said. According to UIA, insurance of government assets would drive penetration up by 1.5 per cent.Insurance Regulatory Authority chief executive officer Ibrahim Kaddunabbi, said what the Central Government owns is very manageable when one looks at the treaties vis-&agrave;-vis the capacity of insurance companies.IRA is currently having discussions with the Central Government because the losses that it incurs as a result of not taking on insurance are tremendous according to Mr Kaddunabbi.They made the remarks on Monday in Kampala while announcing the 44th African Insurance Organisation conference to be hosted by Uganda in May.More than 800 insurance professionals from Africa, Middle East and Europe are expected to attend the four-day meeting to be held from May 21 to 24.Speaking to journalists, Mr Kaddunabbi said the meeting will focus on driving the uptake of insurance services not only to the ordinary Ugandans but of the continent as a whole.The conference comes at a time when Uganda is ready to take on bancassurance, Islamic insurance and agricultural insurance, among other new products.
