Bamako &mdash; PEACE keepers in Mali are enduring daily attacks from militants thriving on the anarchy prevailing in the country. Two attacks have been recorded this week, which left several members of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (Minusma) and civilians injured. A vehicle belonging to the peacekeeping mission has struck an improvised explosive device or mine about 30 kilometres south of Tessalit in the Kidal region. The vehicle, part of an escort of a logistics convoy, has been damaged. In another incident, unidentified armed men have targeted positions of the Malian Armed Forces and the National Guard at Gourma Rharous, located about 120 kilometres east of the capital Timbuktu. "There is hardly a day when reports of abominable acts of terrorism committed by enemies of peace and this country and its people are not received," said Mahamat Saleh Annadif, Minusma head. He described the attacks as cowardly. "Their goal is to impose the reign of violence and chaos." Mali has been in turmoil since a coup in 2012. - CAJ News
