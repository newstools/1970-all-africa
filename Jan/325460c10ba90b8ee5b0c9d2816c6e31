Ex-Big Brother Naija contestant, Ekemini Ekerette, better known as Kemen, has apologised for sexually harassing fellow housemate TBoss before he was evicted from the show.Kemen was on Sunday found to have violated TBoss by touching her inappropriately without her consent and he was disqualified. TBoss on Wednesday disclosed that she was in her period when Kemen sexually assaulted her.In his statement, seeking forgiveness from TBoss and all women, Kemen posted: "Firstly, I hereby tender my sincere apologies to TBoss and ask for her forgiveness as well as all the women in Africa who perceived my action as violation or a sexual offence."I knew that everybody was playing the game in the house at the same time competing for the prize. I realised that I overplayed my game which brought about my disqualification."As you all know, I have my fitness outfit, where I train a lot of people both men and women. There has been no case or report of such acts from me. I regret the turn of play while trying to play and compete for the prize."I must emphasise that reality is different from perception however I also use this medium to apologise to all women being the International Women's Day, and the entire crew of Big Brother Nigeria, including my fans and family
