Gulu &mdash; The Commander of UPDF Land Forces, Maj Gen Peter Elwelu, has called for full military approach to end cases of plunder in Zoka Central Forest Reserve, Adjumani District.Gen Elwelu said the illegal cutting of trees in Zoka Central Forest Reserve for timber is affecting the environment arguing that only military approach can help in throwing out those that are destroying the natural resource.He made the remarks while officiating at the handover ceremony of the 4th Infantry Division office from Col Rugadya Akiki, the 4th Division deputy commander, to Brig Emmanuel Kanyesigye on Monday in Gulu Town.Col Rugadya had been acting as 4th Infantry Division commander for the last four months after Brig Muhanga Kayanja took over a new role as the UPDF contingent commander in Somalia last year.Brig Kanyesigye, former commander of the Military Police, was promoted recently by President Museveni and appointed the 4th Infantry Division commander where he previously served as head between 2012 and 2014."The cutting of trees in Zoka Forest is unacceptable. We are going to have a military operation. We need to flush out those cutting trees from the forest, if we managed to flush out the Lord's Resistance Army in the region, can we fail to flush them out?," he asked.Probing officersIn October last year, the army instituted a special probe committee at the 4th Division headquarters to investigate the alleged involvement of some of its officers in plundering timber in Zoka Forest.The committee then chaired by the 4th Infantry Division Commander, Brig Kayanja, has since failed to come out with names of suspects.Gen Elwelu noted that he has also received reports pinning some military officers as being behind the cutting of timber in Zoka."I hear some of us [UPDF officers] are involved, 4th Infantry Division commander must wake up on this matter and sort out the illegal cutting of trees in the forest," he said.In his maiden speech, Brig Kanyesigye said they [army] will deploy military personnel immediately to Zoka Forest to weed the 'thieves' out of the forest."This time, whichever military or police officer or even a politician we find involved in the deal, we shall arrest and have them prosecuted. We are deploying there immediately to establish who are these people occupying the forest and stealing timber," Brig Kanyesigye said.He added that stopping the illegal cutting of trees in Zoka and other illegal activities under his command will be his key priority.
