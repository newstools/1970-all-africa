It is just not worth it ultimately. There has to be sustained awareness campaigns on the dangers inherent in such journeys."Migration policies are getting tougher all over. In Germany alone, there are about 12,000 Nigerians seeking asylum and they will not be granted. They are likely to be deported."According to the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), 128 migrants, including Nigerians and other West Africans, died while crossing Mediterranean Sea to Europe between March 6 and 26, 2017.
