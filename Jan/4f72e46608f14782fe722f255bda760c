Following the increased adoption rate of solar and inverter technologies in Nigeria in recent times, the Managing Director, Cloud Energy Photoelectric Limited, Theophilus Nweke, has predicted that the country would surpass Africa's renewable energy target by 2020.In 2016, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), in collaboration with other international agencies that focussed on renewable energy, had set a target of 2020 for Africa to expand the renewable energy capacities as well as achieve universal access. In Nigeria the target was accepted with major doubts given the nations failures to meet all set development targets.But given the increased adoption rate of renewable energy technologies across the country, Nweke said Nigeria would likely surpass NEPAD's target for Nigeria before 2020."Nigeria looks set to spring a surprise according to a survey, by a team of market monitors that led to the launch of the Cloud Energy Solar Access Program. Nigerians, according to the survey, were already adopting solar and inverter technologies in large numbers," Nweke said.He added that the current trend showed that more young and middle aged professionals, spurred by necessity and without any nudging from the government, are getting over the frustrations of electricity supply by switching to solar just as in portable water where every other home owns a treated borehole.According to Nweke, the Cloud Energy Solar Access Programme supports this trend by removing the barrier of high costs with up to 12-month payment plan for Solar and Inverter bundles designed to create easier and effective access to solar energy.The Cloud Energy boss explained that the solar access program is for all Nigerians, employed and self-employed who own homes or live in a rented apartment, for big and small offices, schools, cooperatives, churches, mosques, banks, military and para-military institutions.He said that everyone who wish to participate in the program need to produce valid identification, evidence of gainful or self-employment, evidence of responsible citizenship like utility bills, and a reference letter from a bank."With an initial payment of 30 per cent of total cost and a plan that spreads the balance over 12 months, the solar or inverter bundle is installed. All products in the bundle enjoy manufacturers' warranty up to 25 years," Nweke added.He informed that the Cloud Energy Solar Access Programme was also designed to educate the public on the benefits of using solar as a means of quickening the pace of the nation towards the attainment of the renewable energy goals of 2020. The programme contributes to the fight against climate change and would create thousands of jobs in the clean energy sector, Nweke said.Other benefits include a substantial reduction on electric bills even if they are estimated, increased productivity and 24/7 entertainment. He urged Nigerians, individual and corporate to key into the Cloud Energy Solar Access Programme to become active participants in nation building.
