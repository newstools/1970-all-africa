The !Gobaub concession awarded to the Hai-//om San community five years ago for tourism and wildlife projects is under dispute, while no investor has been found yet.John //Khamuseb, special adviser to Kunene regional governor Angelika Muharukua, yesterday said the awarding of the tourism concession to the Hai//om, under the !Gobaub association, was to enable the community to generate revenue. It was also why government purchased farms along the borders of the Etosha National Park, with two more still to be purchased.//Khamuseb said the reason the concession has failed to take off was due to many squabbles within the Hai//om community, and this has delayed the implementation of the concession, which The Namibian understands to be for 25 years.The Namibian was informed that the relationship between the Hai//om Traditional Authority and the conservancy fell apart after some members of the conservancy wanted the !Gobaub association to be a separate entity, and not part of the traditional authority.Hai//om chief David //Khamugab confirmed the concession, located in the southern part of the Etosha National Park, during an interview with The Namibian a month ago.//Khamugab also expressed frustration at the slow pace of implementation of the concession."The concession has been there for the past five years, but nothing has been happening. It's just there," he stated.He said there has not been much communication from government, but they hoped to advertise for a partner soon.//Khamugab said they received proposals from three entities, namely the Ongava Game Reserve, Namibia Wilderness Safaris and Namibia Wildlife Resorts."We have an eye to see who are the best people to partner. Ongava has always been quiet, but they are the people who are in our area, and are sitting on some of the farms we grew up on. They can partner us because their ideas are also good," said the chief.Sources have accused the Hai//om Traditional Authority of favouring Ongava, and have called for the concession to be advertised so that more entities can express interest.Tourism minister Pohamba Shifeta in a letter last year also called on the traditional authority to advertise the concession.The concession is part of government's efforts to improve the lives of the Hai//om, who lost their ancestral land when Etosha became a national park prior to independence.Independent consultant Rogers Collinson last week told The Namibian that he had been behind the setting-up of the !Gobaub concession, and also expressed concern about the slow implementation.Collinson said he had worked with many Hai//om, and based on this, motivated government to buy farms on the periphery of Etosha.Wilderness Safaris signed a memorandum of understanding with the traditional authority last year in order to get permission to do a feasibility study on the viability of the concession.Wilderness' community engagement manager, Jermain Ketji, said the MoU was initially for six months - from March to September 2016 - and was extended for another six months, from January to July 2017."We successfully concluded and are convinced that it is something we can invest in," said Ketji.As part of government's efforts to restore land that was taken from the Hai//om when they were moved from Etosha, Cabinet decided in 2004 to purchase 45 000 hectares, which was done, and to empower the San community through tourism and wildlife projects.Seven farms were purchased since 2004 in the Outjo district, with two others in the Tsumeb and Guinas constituencies.Some of the farms situated next to Etosha are Koppies, Mooiplaas, Nuchas, Werda and Seringkop. The tourism ministry's spokesperson, Romeo Muyunda, did not respond to questions sent to him this week.
