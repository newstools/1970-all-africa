Forgive my obsession with eyebrows. It turns out I am not in this alone.The rest of the world is and you better be too. The eyes are the centre of attraction on the face, which means you want to have everything around them in perfect shape, starting with the lashes and the eyebrows.For some reason, the brows seem to be taking the lion's share of the attention, perhaps due to the fact that there is a lot you can do with them; so, you have no excuse not to.Now innovators are losing sleep as they come up with all these ideas. Just as we were settling in with the stencils, they have unleashed the wig! This is by far the easiest solution.Thin eyebrows are a thing of the past. Now if you need a full and thick eyebrow, grab a wig; the most important thing is it should be well shaped.If you are having trouble growing your own eyebrows due to disease or treatment including chemotherapy, or you simply over-plucked yours, just stick on these false ones and you are good to go.The beauty is that they are made from natural hair and you are assured of a natural look. All you have to do is choose the shape that suits your face.They are the reason behind the dramatic eyebrow transformations of many celebrities including Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz.Now you have no reason to walk around with bad eyebrows.
