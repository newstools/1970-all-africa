The Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) is working on the reintroduction of the compulsory monthly sanitation exercise.The exercise, which is billed for the last Saturday of each month, is compulsory and aimed at dealing with the lingering environmental problems in the council.AMAC chairman, Abdullahi Adamu Candido, said there was need to urgently tackle the environmental sanitation problem in the council which had become more complicated with the rapid population growth and daily migration of people from other parts of the country to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)."The unsanitary condition of our villages and communities is appalling and needs a great sanitary awakening. That's why I call on all and sundry to partner with the council to rid our surroundings of refuse and restore sanctity in our environments," he said.Candido spoke on Thursday at the passing-out parade and official launching of the AMAC Environmental Enforcement Cadet mandated to educate and enlighten residents on good environmental practices and also enforce discipline.He appealed for compliance from residents in ensuring the success of the exercise.He also said all market managements within the area council should engage in weekly sanitation exercise to maintain a clean business environment.
