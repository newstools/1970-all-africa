The outspoken opposition MP Kamlepo Kalua has accused former minister of agriculture George Chaponda of masterminding his alleged abduction. Kalua says he was a target because of his open criticism of the government and his claims that he will reveal names of corrupt cabinet ministers. President Peter Mutharika fired Chaponda in February following a series of allegations of corrupt practices in the maize procurement process from Zambia.
