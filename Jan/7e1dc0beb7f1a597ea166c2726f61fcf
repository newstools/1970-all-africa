Muhammad Abdallah (rtd), said the agency would build a standard rehabilitation centre in Abuja.This he said would help in filling the yearning gap in rehabilitating youths that had fallen needlessly by the way side &lrm;back into the society.&lrm;"At the moment, there isn't a single standard rehab centre in Nigeria. Even as the youths make up between 60 and 70 per cent of its population and indeed constitute the vulnerable group, who after falling by the way side, must be rehabilitated and re-integrated into the larger society."It is to fill this yearning gap &lrm;that the NDLEA is proposing to build a standard rehabilitation centre in Abuja for a start and other locations later. The Minister of Federal Capital Territory has assured that land will be made available," he added.
