If you look at the calendar, you would wonder in what ways and manner we can celebrate Lagos. Without your sector, there is no Lagos."So, when we say 50 years, we are talking about 50 years of history, so somebody documents it, somebody dramatizes it, and then somebody keeps it, so that those who are yet unborn would see it, so even when we are not there, it would be displayed through your creative talents," Mr Ambode was quoted by Nigerian press.AMAA founder Ms. Peace Anyiam-Osigwe said her organization looks forward to a strategic relationship with the state that will promote the entire creative industry as a major contributor to the economy of the state and the nation's Gross Domestic Product.She said, "We are humbled and very much grateful for the honour to have Lagos as our official host State for AMAA 2017. It is amazing to have a Governor in Lagos States that supports and invests in the creative sector of our economy. Entertainment and tourism are integral part of Lagos State Government's policy to create employment and opportunities for youths."Over 400 film entries from 72 countries have been received.
