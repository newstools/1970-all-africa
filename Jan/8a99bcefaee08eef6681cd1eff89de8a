Cases of violent extremism and radicalisation of youths have declined in Isiolo County.County security team, religious leaders and peace stakeholders in the region attributed the decline to campaigns conducted last year to sensitize young people against joining terror groups.Isiolo County Commissioner George Natembeya said majority of 27 youths who had crossed the border to join Al-Shabab in Somalia last year returned home.The returnees, he said, have undergone rehabilitation in a programme sponsored by the government.Last year, five young men from Isiolo were arrested at the border while on their way to join the Somali-based Islamist group.A multi-agency committee constituting all police departments had also been formed to fight terrorism in the county."Through the help of some returnees, we managed to reach out to a group of youths who had intentions of joining the terror groups. Narrations from the returnees about their real experiences at the camps made those targeted to change their decision," said Mr Natembeya.Isiolo was last year identified as one of the recruitment ground for Al-Shabaab fighters in the country.The anti-radicalisation campaigns were also conducted in schools, mosques and churches.According to the county chief, no suspected recruiter or radicalised persons has been arrested since December last year.Isiolo Inter-faith Based Organisation Chairman Ahmed Set said false religious ideologies was to blame for increased radicalisation in the region."Sheikhs and Imams played a very critical role in preaching against the vice in mosques," he said.
