The ministry is also distributing chlorine to the communities for water treatment. In addition, the ministry is sending out cholera control information to all the people including those travelling to the cholera-affected places in Mozambique. "The ministry is doing everything possible to prevent any cholera outbreak that may arise from the visits to this area and also within the country," said Chikumbe.
