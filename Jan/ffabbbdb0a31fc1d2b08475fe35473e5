I am making 24 years this month.What inspired you to join the music industry?I have loved music since my days at high school [she attended Rubaga Girls secondary school for O and A-levels]. I also used to dance; so, I didn't just fall into it. I have been around for five years as a dancer and an artiste. Music has always been part of me. I have enjoyed my journey with it. I know what to do and what not to do.How has Swangz Avenue helped grow your career?Swangz has always been there with me from day-one. They discovered me, they believed in me. Swangz is [my] family.Should we expect an album?I have so far released three songs (Stylo, Level and In the Mood). The rest are on the way. I am not in a rush to release an album. It will take some time before I release one.What advice do you give to upcoming artistes?They should behave well and stay humble. They should resect themselves and their fans. I have been in the music business for close to five years as an artiste, manager and a dancer. I have seen people mess up and lose their way. All I can ask them is to stay humble.Which Ugandan artiste inspires you?That is Cindy. I love the way she sings. I would want to have a music collaboration with her.What other collaborations would you like to have?I would love to make collaborations with Sheebah Karungi, Bebe Cool and Ziza Bafana.
