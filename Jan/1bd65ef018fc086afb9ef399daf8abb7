The reign of Eldad Epiaka Odongkara will soon come to an end as the search of a new Miss Tourism kicks off at the Uganda museum this evening.The launch starts at 6pm with a cocktail for the invited guests, various stakeholders, selected pressmen and various partners."This is one roller coaster which I will forever hold in my heart. From meeting new friends, changing lives, holding a cultural festival; not to mention all the knowledge I acquired about tourism and, most of all, representing my country," Odongkara says.Last year, Chatha Motors gave away a Toyota Ipsum to Odongkara. For the pageant's fifth time, Radiant Cosmetics will reward the winner with a BMW mini cooper and a cash prize that will be announced at the grand finale on September 29 at Kampala Serena hotel's Victoria hall.Olivia Nanteza, who won Face of Radiant last year, says having a cosmetic company on board for a beauty pageant is one of the best catches because it helps portray the beauty of the Ugandan woman.After the launch, the regional tours will kick off the following week, and a beauty queen will be chosen.
