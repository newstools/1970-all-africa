On this year's World Kidney Day with the theme: "Kidney &amp; Obesity", a Consultant Physician/ Nephrologist, Dr Ebun Bamgboye, raised alarm over the increasing cases of kidney- related diseasorders in the country, saying, 1 in 5 or approximately 34 million Nigerians have kidney disease.Bamgboye who is the Clinical Director at St Nicholas Hospital, Lagos, disclosed that the hospital treats over 120 kidney disease patients annually averaging 10 new cases every month.Bambgoye who spoke during the hospital's annual free health screening exercise, blamed the situation, which he said was an emergency, as the unprecedented surge in cases of hypertension, diabetes and obesity among Nigerians.He noted that 30 per cent of adult Nigerians have High Blood Pressure, HBP, and called on government to implement programmes for the prevention, screening, and treatment of kidney disease."The number of patients with End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, will continue to increase unless the delivery of optimal preventive medical care to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease is addressed.Bamgboye said kidney disease can be prevented and progression slowed with early identification and treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease, CKD.To reverse the trend, he said: "There are sound and cost-effective models of screening and treatment of kidney diseases that could be integrated within the health care systems for effective outreach and improved patient outcomes."If you are obese, you are likely to have HBP and diabetes. And these impact so much on the kidneys. If you are obese by the time you are 20 you have shortened your lifespan by 13 years."According to the World Health Organization, WHO, at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.Bamgboye stressed the need for Nigerians to monitor their blood pressure, sugar level and exercise regularly. People should learn to eat right because obesity has been linked to imbalance in calorie intake and energy expenditure leads to weight gain.
