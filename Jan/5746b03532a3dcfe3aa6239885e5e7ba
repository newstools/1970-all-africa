Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has explained why the country must be restructured to reflect true federalism.He made his position known on Tuesday when he hosted the United States of America (U.S.A)'s Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. William Symington and the Consul General, John Bray at the Government House, Port Harcourt.Wike said those advocating true federalism in the country are not secessionists, but true believers in a united Nigeria where no section is denied the right to control its resources.According to him, the Rivers State's people are insisting on true federalism because they want to develop with their resources."When people clamour for true federalism, some people erroneously think that they don't want to be part of Nigeria.But rather, what we want is true federalism as practised in America."We want a true presidential system where the federating units would be allowed to control their resources and contribute to the centre. In that context, there must be a country called Nigeria, to which the units would contribute," he said.Wike stressed that the people are seeking equity, fairness and justice to create the right framework to make the states to excel.The state's Head of Service, Mr. Rufus Godwins added that the state had suffered untold hardship in the country, as its resources are exploited to the benefit of others.He urged the U.S. to take steps to check the rape of democracy by Federal Government agencies ahead of the next elections.Wike also urged the U.S. government to establish avisa office in Port Harcourt to address the need of the south-south and south-east.He said doing so would bring equity and justice, since the visa office in Abuja is serving the northern Nigeria, while the Lagos office serves the southwest.He told the envoys that the state is safe for the U.S. to invest, adding that the right environment for business has already been created.The ambassador commended the unity of Nigeria, saying the country would become a super power and a partner.
