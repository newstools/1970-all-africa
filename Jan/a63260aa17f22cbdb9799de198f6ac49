Washington, DC &mdash; House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA), joined by Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Karen Bass (D-CA), introduced today the AGOA and MCA Modernization Act (H.R. 3445).&nbsp; The bipartisan legislation strengthens both the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Millennium Challenge Act (MCA).AGOA is landmark trade legislation first passed in 2000 to develop a trade relationship between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp; And MCA established the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which provides large-scale grants to promote economic growth opportunities in developing countries committed to good governance.&nbsp; Together, these laws have helped increase trade between the U.S. and Africa.On the introduction of H.R. 3445, Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, Rep. Smith and Rep. Bass said: &ldquo;Moving developing countries away from aid and toward trade helps African companies, especially women.&nbsp; But it also benefits U.S. farmers, manufacturers and small businesses by providing new markets for their goods.&nbsp; So today we are introducing a bill to modernize AGOA and MCA &ndash; key laws in the effort to encourage African economic independence and promote U.S.-Africa trade.&nbsp; With Africa&rsquo;s consumer spending expected to reach one trillion dollars, now is the time to accelerate this important trade relationship.&rdquo;Specifically the bill:A section-by-section summary of the legislation is available HERE.
