A joint technical team will be put in place to follow up on the agreement as regards what we need from them and what they need from us," Gatete said.The Congolese minister for finance and budget, Callixte Nganongo, said the cooperation will help enhance public finance management that is favourable for commercial activities."Consolidation of public finance is of great consideration.

Beyond the words, we have to proceed with actions."
