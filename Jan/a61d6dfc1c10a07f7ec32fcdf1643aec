If you are a first-timer to the Carnival restaurant located along Coral Crescent in Kololo, the long corridor leading to the dining areas will authenticate the carnival feel of the place.The corridor has ropes hanging loosely along the sides, with dim light and pictures of different animals completing the d&eacute;cor. Inside, each dining area has its own theme colour with a podium where live performances are done.And last Friday this was the venue for the Huawei media club party for their members. Journalists from different media houses swarmed the restaurant at 7pm to drink, eat, dance and make merry.During dinner, the most supportive media personalities were rewarded for their publications about Huawei Uganda. Dinner started with waiters taking journalists through the unique menu and sharing the 'terms and conditions' of their meals.The restaurant is famous for its unique relationship with meats. In fact, if you care less about all the scares out there about red meat and just love a good steak, Carnival is the 'it'.The waiter told us about the meat served coming from domestic but also game meat including crocodile, buffalo and others. I wanted a taste of the wild and got myself some buffalo meat, which tested beautifully salty and crunchy, the taste lingering in my mouth long after swallowing.When time came to be served crocodile meat, many, including Yours Truly, chickened out. For the adventurous few that went ahead and dug in, they looked to be enjoying the white meat. Crocodile meat is said to taste like fish, only much, much better.What a refreshing change in my Ugandan dining experience!
