The Bishop of the New Water in the Desert Assembly Reverend Kortu Brown says he encourages the establishment of war crimes court for Liberia to serve as a deterrent and safeguard the country's nascent democracy.He said it is important consideration be given the lingering proposal for a war crimes court so as to serve as a deterrent to people wanting to incite electoral violence.Bishop Brown believes such a court warrant will ensure that the democratic gains made so far in Liberia are protected.Bishop Brown also stressed that due to the critical nature of the 2017 Representative and Presidential elections, everything must be done to ensure that the process is peaceful and the results re-assuring.The New Water in the Desert Pastor appealed to ECOWAS, the African Union, European Union, United Nations and the United States to stand with Liberia by ensuring that the rule of law is strengthened.The Pentecostal Bishop said threats by certain politicians to resort to violence if disqualified by the Code of Conduct were not in the best interest of the country.He then warned that there is no justification for Liberia to slip back into another round of violence after nearly ten years of uninterrupted peace.Bishop Brown said the country has seen unprecedented political violence in the last 40 years than probably any other country in West Africa.He cited strings of historical instances dating back from the Rice Riot of 1979 to the bloody coup of 1980; the Nimba raid of 1983 to the post-elections invasion in 1985 culminating into the fifteen-year civil war which began in 1989. He said Liberians of all persuasions pray for a better day when the country will be peaceful and stable and their government operates under the rule of law.However, in post-civil war Liberia, Rev. Brown said that, it is an irony that when an argument breaks out on anything of national consequence, some Liberians who may feel directly aggrieved will want to resolve their differences through violence means.
