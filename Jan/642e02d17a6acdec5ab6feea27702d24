It is hard to develop the skills if we keep giving away jobs that our people can do," he said.He advocated for the use of African corporations to incubate and develop skills across the continent.He said this would see the continent increase available relevant and practical skills across various aspectsThierry Zomahoun the Chief executive of the Next Einstein Forum noted the importance of being forward thinking and future oriented in skills and capacity development.
