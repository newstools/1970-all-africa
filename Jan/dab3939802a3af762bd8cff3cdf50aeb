The remaining white commercial farmers should vacate their properties and relocate to "Borrowdale in Harare where they can relax and play golf" to make way for landless youths, the ruling Zanu-PF party national youth leader Kudzai Chipanga has said during a rally addressed by President Robert Mugabe. Mugabe has begun a nationwide series of rallies to drum up support from youths ahead of elections next year.
