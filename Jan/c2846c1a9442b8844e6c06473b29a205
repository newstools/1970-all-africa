The Snapper Hill Headquarters of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) was yesterday a scene of celebration when the bank's employees, well dressed in African attire of various types put on a lively show in observance of Africa Day (formerly Africa Liberation Day), celebrated on May 25 each year. The UBA celebration, which began as early as 8:00 a.m. prior to opening for business, included captivating drumming and dancing by the attractively dressed employees, perhaps the only ones giving the day any sense of festivity and African culture. Africa Day is celebrated annually on May 25 to mark the determination of the people of Africa to liberate the continent from foreign domination and exploitation.
