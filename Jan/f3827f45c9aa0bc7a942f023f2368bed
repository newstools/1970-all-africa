Around two-thirds of the population live off of agriculture, with about 80 percent of the local labour force gaining jobs through this sector. It also provides most of the inputs for transformative industries such as edible oils, sugar and fibers, the UN statement reads.The CPF aims to support the development of many crucial elements of this country's agricultural sector, including raising income and employment as well as enhancing food security and poverty reduction, while also increasing agricultural exports and adding further linkages between agriculture and other key economic sectors.Sustainable developmentThe CPF is aligned with Sudan's national development objectives, which are articulated in its Quarter Centurial Development Strategy, National Development Plan, Comprehensive Food Security Policy and National Agriculture Investment Plan, in addition to FAO's global and regional objectives.As part of the CPF's priority areas, FAO will work in close collaboration with the GOS to enhance the design and implementation of policies and the development of programmes to improve agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries, and to ensure food security and nutrition for all.Furthermore, FAO will support the GOS in developing enhanced methods towards managing its natural resources through better planning and boosting agricultural production by connecting various players in the sector to local, regional, and international influencers along the value chain. Finally, the CPF will work with the GOS to make the country less vulnerable to climate change and to better sustain affected persons in areas of conflict and environmental concern.The Government of Sudan and FAO will implement the programme with support from the wider spectrum of stakeholders within the private sector, semi-government institutions and civil society.$17 million already mobilisedFAO has already sourced $17 million, out of $ 72 million that is required to implement the programmes and projects that are proposed in the Framework."We will continue working with the Government of Sudan to mobilize the remaining $ 55 million through FAO's Technical Corporation Programme (TCP) and Trust Funds from development partners, as well as from the Government's budgetary allocations," said Ahmadu.
