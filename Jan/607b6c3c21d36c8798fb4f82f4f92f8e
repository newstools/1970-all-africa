Kampala &mdash; Uganda's insurance premium costs are about 18 percent higher than they should be because of fraud reported in the sector, Uganda Insurers Association (UIA) has said.According to Mr Deepak Pandey, the UIA chairperson and Managing Director Jubilee Holdings Uganda, the research conducted by KPMG in 2015 indicates that fraud in the sector is still rampant with at least 12 per cent of all insurance players in Uganda confirming that they are exposed to insurance fraud.According to the KPMG East Africa Insurance Fraud Risk Survey, detected fraud is estimated about $10,000 (Shs36m) while total fraud in the sector at $500,000 (Shs1.7b) annually."The cost of insurance fraud to the sector has gone up by 18 per cent because of fraud and some of these cases are ending up in the courts of law and taking too long to be resolved," Mr Pandey told reporters on the sidelines of training for judicial officers in Kampala last week.Uganda was noted in the report to have exaggerated levels of false claims and non-disclosures by policyholders.Mr Pandey said it was important for the judiciary to understand ways of minimising and identifying fraudulent claims. The genuine policyholders often pay the price for the fraudulent claims because they incur the cost to bridge any shortfalls as a result.A recent estimate points to about 5 per cent of insurance revenue being lost to fraud. Data on the exact cost of fraud is still scanty and the regulator is yet to carry out a survey on the same subject."There is no clear data that can tell the exact amounts being lost to fraud by insurance companies.From several reports, we estimate that the firms lost about 5 percent of 'gross revenues in 2016 to fraudulent activities," Mr Mustapha Mugisha, a forensic specialist and fraud examiner said recently.One of the negative perceptions around insurance is that claims are not paid by players.
