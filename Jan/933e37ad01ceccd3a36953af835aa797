Nearly a decade after Zimbabwean schools received textbooks under the donor-sponsored Education Transition Fund (ETF) teachers are reportedly shunning the use of the textbooks says Primary and Secondary Education Minister.ETF was set up to rescue the country's education system which was teetering on the brink of collapse as the country battled a serious economic crisis which peaked around 2008.Primary and Secondary Education Minister Lazarus Dokora, speaking on the side-lines of a recent headmasters' meeting in Kwekwe, said that the books are being underutilised."It is disturbing to note that we still have brand new books in schools which were distributed under the ETF are still wrapped in their covers," said Dokora."What this only shows is that the books are being underutilized. There are some teachers who are shunning the use of the ETF books and that has to stop," he said.The education ministry, then led by David Coltart during the inclusive government in 2009, launched the ETF to support rehabilitation of the country's education sector. Dokora was deputy education minister then.Teachers have however, come out guns blazing against the minister's new education curriculum which they claim rendered some textbooks irrelevant."Teachers are generally not motivated by their pathetic salaries and are just doing enough not to be fired," Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe President Obert Masaraure said.He added, "On the other hand, the change in the curriculum has rendered some textbooks useless."The objectives and content of the new education blueprint cannot be covered by some textbooks. There is need to secure new relevant textbooks."Teachers' unions have roundly condemned Dokora, especially on the introduction of the new curriculum.Zimbabwe Teachers Union Spokesperson Tapson Nganunu Sibanda is quoted as saying, "the new curriculum has its own shortcomings."Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe Secretary General Raymond Majongwe also rapped the government and said that teachers were working under "atrocious" conditions.Education crisisETF was established to improve the quality of Zimbabwe's basic education through the provision of learning materials.Under the programme over 13 million textbooks were distributed in Primary and Secondary schools.The move came after assessments had revealed serious shortages of textbooks and other supplies in schools.In 2009 an average of 10 pupil were sharing a single textbook, with a 20% of primary schools having no textbooks at all for subjects such as English, Mathematics or the mother tongue.The European Commission on behalf of the EU allocated 7, 5 million Euros to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Zimbabwe to finance the ETF.This was enhanced by a pledge from five European Union nations and five other countries to a tune of over $50 million.Dokora has been at crosshairs with various stakeholders after, earlier this year, introducing a new curriculum in schools."This was a necessary patch that we had to go through," Dokora said of the new curriculum.He added that government has since availed US $9 million for acquisition of learning materials under the new curriculum.The Minister, who has also been caught in the eye of the storm after introducing the National Pledge, has since said that there is no going back on the new curriculum.
