"The hunger crisis in the country is dire and the people most affected need all the help they can get - immediately," said Joyce Luma, WFP's Representative and Country Director in South Sudan. "China's contribution will enable us to continue our assistance which is a life-line for millions of people in the country."South Sudan is experiencing the worst levels of acute hunger since independence with pockets of famine affecting more than 90,000 people in parts of former Unity State. In all, an estimated 5.5 million people in the country are not sure where their next meal will come from. The contribution from China will allow WFP to buy and distribute about 2,400 metric tons of sorghum, the local staple. This is the second time in two years that China is contributing to WFP's food assistance operation in the country."The deterioration of the humanitarian situation due to conflict and instability in South Sudan is alarming and China, as a true friend, stands ready to support the country through both bilateral and multilateral channels," said H.E. Mr. He Xiangdong, Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan. "China highly appreciates WFP's efforts to fight hunger in South Sudan and believes that this contribution will rapidly reach those who are most in need," he added.In 2017, WFP South Sudan plans to assist about 4.1 million people through its emergency and recovery operations. WFP requires additional funding of US$189 million to continue providing food and nutrition assistance in the coming six months.
