CAR insurance has spurred growth for short- term insurance companies since 2012 amid liquidity constraints and growing risk related to the sector, an Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) report has revealed.In its report for 2016 IPEC said car insurance had grown due to the growth in vehicle population in the country."The increase could be explained by the introduction of electric cover notes which meant that most vehicles previously insured using fake cover notes are now insured with genuine electronic cover notes and a natural growth in vehicle population," said IPEC in its quarterly non-life insurance report.Non-life insurers' total gross premium written (GPW) has been on the rise since 2012, up from US$189,92 million in 2012 to US$215,97 million in 2016.GPW for the non-life industry grew by 1,19 percent from US$213,44 million in 2015 to US$215,97 million for the year to December 31, 2016.During the year under review, GPW from the motor insurance business grew by US$7,41 million, cushioning most short-term insurance companies from economic hardships and skepticism towards insurance."The slight overall increase recorded in business written in terms of total GPW was mainly driven by growth in motor insurance business. Total premium generated from motor insurance increased by US$7,41 million from US$85,74 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 to US$93,14 million for the year under review," IPEC said.Business generated by non-life assurance companies was mainly skewed towards motor insurance and fire in 2016, with insurance companies such as NicozDiamond also recording a surge in motor vehicle insurance.NicozDiamond's motor vehicle book grew by eight percent in 2016."Motor remains the dominant class of insurance for the short-term insurance sector as well as for the company," NicozDiamond chairman, James Karidza, said.The company's motor insurance book was enhanced by the acquisition of electronic cover notes that also impacted on its cost base.Industry experts recently said there was a rise in motor vehicle claims due to the torrential rains that have exacerbated the state of the roads, leading to an increase in accidents.Motor vehicle insurance claims have gone up 40 percent since the start of the rainy season characterised by flash floods, which worsened potholes with reports that some insurance companies paid over US$500 000 in claims in just two weeks.Motor vehicle policies form the bulk of insurance claims in Zimbabwe, where citizens are still hesitant to invest in other forms of cover following the hyperinflationary era which peaked in 2008 when the Zimbabwe dollar lost its value resulting in Zimbabweans losing their savings.Zimbabwe's insurance penetration rate is in decline since its peak of 5,7 percent in 2004.It is currently at its lowest of 1,5 percent while in 1990 the sector was ranked among the most mature insurance markets in the developing world.In 2016, the insurance industry's asset base marginally increased by US$3,45 million to US$375,57 million."The industry's average prescribed asset ratios for non-life insurers and reinsurers were 12,08 percent and 12,26 percent respectively as at December 31(2016), compared to the minimum requirement of five percent, demonstrating a much higher commitment than required," said IPEC.During the reporting period, the business written by reinsurers declined from US$103,83 million in 2015 to US$99,93 million in 2016.The operating environment in the short term insurance sector is expected to be characterised by subdued growth, liquidity constraints and softening of rates, affecting the revenue base.Short-term insurers have also been grappling with rising cases of fraudulent claims.During the period under review, the number of registered non-life insurance agents and loss adjusters decreased from 611 as at September 30 2015 to 573 as at December 31 2016 mainly due to reductions in the number of sole agents by 31 participants.The non-life insurance contribution to the country's gross domestic product was constant at 1,52 percent, mainly due to constant per capita spending on non life insurance.Non life insurance density penetration marginally increased from US$14,54 in 2012 to US$15,17 in 2016, showing a slight improvement in perceived risk.All the registered non-life insurance companies, except Credit Insurance Company, reported capital positions which were compliant with the requirement of US$1,5 million as at December 2016.newsdesk@fingaz.co.zw
