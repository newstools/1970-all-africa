I am now confident and have overcome my nervousness after going through the various stages of the competition.In five years time, Helen says she wants to see herself competing with international models."I believe I have what it takes to compete with the international models. For now, I need serious grooming and in no time I will be one of the best models around" she said.Ms Belinda Baidoo CEO of The Belinda Baidoo Model Search Africa (BBSA) told Showbiz that Afia won because she impressed all the judges."I was surprised at the way she answered almost all the questions thrown at her.
