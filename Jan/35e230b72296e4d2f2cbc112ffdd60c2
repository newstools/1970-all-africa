Leaders from Samburu County have asked the government to immediately withdraw the Kenya Defence Forces from Laikipia County.Governor Moses Lenolkulal and MPs Lati Lelelit (Samburu West) and Alloys Lentoimaga (Samburu North) have called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop the ongoing security operation.The leaders argued that security personnel are using the operation to torture, maim and harass innocent residents of Laikipia.They further demanded a meeting with President Kenyatta to iron out the Laikipia issue whose effects they said are spilling over to Samburu County.The leaders cited poisoning of water sources used by people, wildlife and livestock, torching of homes, shooting and killing of livestock and illegal arrests of innocent locals as some of the injustices committed by security personnel.They spoke at the Samburu County headquarters in Maralal Town on Wednesday evening.PERTURBED"As Samburu leaders, we are perturbed by what is happening in Laikipia County."We strongly condemn the actions by security personnel undertaking the ongoing operation. Indiscriminate killing of livestock will harm the pastoralists' main source of livelihood," said Governor Lenolkulal.The governor wants the operation halted and another alternative way of solving the issue sought."The government has enough resources and machineries to get to the bottom of this. We have a few criminals but unfortunately what is happening now is a humiliation," added the governor.LOST MEANINGOn his part, Mr Lelelit faulted the operation saying it has lost meaning."The operation was meant to help in the recovery of illegally held guns, but the commanders leading their teams have directed harassment of people from certain communities. I was personally in Laikipia yesterday and what is taking place there is purely crimes against humanity," said Mr Lelelit.The three leaders also claimed that identification cards from two pastoralist communities are being confiscated by security agents in Laikipia.The leaders further accused politicians from Laikipia County of turning the operation "political"."We know there are local politicians in Laikipia who do not want our people there, and some who want to change the voting pattern. So they are taking advantage of the operation," added Mr Lelelit.They threatened to call for mass action in two weeks' time to recover the confiscated IDs.
