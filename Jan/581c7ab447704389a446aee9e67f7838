Buikwe &mdash; Trade minister Amelia Kyambadde has appealed to Ugandans to buy locally manufactured products from the various industries in order to boost the economy.The minister, while on a tour of Southern Range Textile Nyanza Ltd in Buikwe on Monday, said Ugandans need to support the economy through the Buy Uganda Build Uganda programme such that the money circulates within the country for national development.The factory has installed Shs20 billion innovations that are expected to increase the capacity for production. The refurbished factory is expected to be officially commissioned by President Museveni in July."President Museveni is expected to commission the new project, and I am sure he will be impressed when he comes and we will all see that all the problems raised by the workers are resolved," she said.The director of the factory, Mr Richard Mubiru, said the new weaving machine will increase production capacity by 50,000 metres from 80,000 to 130,000 metres of fabric daily."We are facing problem with government institutions that we supply with uniforms because they do not pay us in time. I see supplies from foreign countries are paid in time even before the items are delivered," Mr Mubiru said.He said said the quality of the clothes from the factory also suites foreign markets.The factory manufactures medical useable items such as gauze, bandages and cotton wool that will be in the market beginning January next year.It also offers fashion and uniform fabrics; bed sheets, duvets, and table cloths; and knitwear, sportswear, casual wear, lingerie, and institutional uniforms.
