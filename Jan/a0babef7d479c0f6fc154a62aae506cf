Hsinchu, Taiwan &mdash; Faraday Technology Corporation (TWSE: 3035), a leading ASIC design service and IP provider, today announced the availability of the proven V-by-One&reg; HS PHY &amp; Controller IP on UMC 28HPCU process technology. Faraday's in-house developed IPs are compliant with V-by-One HS standard version 1.4 and are able to support both TX and RX up to 4 Gbps data rate, targeting to drive better visual experience on automotive infotainment system, automotive surround view system, and UHD display.For more than a decade, Faraday has been cooperating with display manufacturers to develop T-Con ASICs with high-speed video interface solutions such as LVDS IPs, which allows Faraday to accumulate system know-how and experience on this topic. By entering the advanced 28nm/40nm process technology, Faraday aims to apply the V-by-One HS IPs to high-bandwidth video transmissions from chip to chip, enabling higher resolution for displays over LVDS-based solutions. For better transmission signal quality and anti-noise capability, Faraday optimizes the design architecture to compensate the transmission losses in the system."High-bandwidth data transmission is one of the key IP development strategies in Faraday. We can offer the ASIC industry's most comprehensive interface IP solutions for display and image capture, including LVDS, Sub-LVDS, MIPI, and V-by-One," said Steve Wang, President of Faraday. "Following our success in 0.13um and 40nm V-by-One IPs, we are confident in accelerating customers' time-to-market for display systems with seamless integration of V-by-One HS PHY and controller on the 28nm node."About Faraday Technology CorporationFaraday Technology Corporation (TWSE: 3035) is a leading ASIC design service and IP provider.
