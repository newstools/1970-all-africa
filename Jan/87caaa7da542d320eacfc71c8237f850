The Nigerian Navy has directed its officers and men of the Nigeria Naval Logistics Command, Oghara, Delta State not to take for granted the current seeming peace in the Niger Delta to move freely un-accompanied with the feeling that all was well.The out-gone Flag Officer Commanding, Naval Headquarters Logistics Command, Oghara, Rear Admiral Begory Ibe-Enwo, who gave the charge at his handing over ceremony to the new Flag Officer Commanding, Rear Admiral Peter Onaji, said, "Do not be carried away by the current seeming peace here in the Niger Delta. You must not move alone. Move in groups to ensure safety."Addressing the officers and men of the command moments before leaving for Naval Headquarters, Abuja, where he has assumed duty as Principal Assistant to the Chief of Naval Staff and Head of Operations, Standard and Safety, Admiral Ibe-Enwo said: "You cannot tell what will happen in the next hour. Do not be carried away by the current seeming peace in the region as it is crisis prone with activities of dare devil criminals."He advised them to be prudent in the management of their resources for optimum results, saying, "You can be thinking that all is well but you do not know what is going on in the minds of people that are on the same streets with you."The admiral who assumed duty in the command as FOC on May 9, 2016, also enjoined the officers to work in synergy with other military outfits in the region and cooperate with the new FOC, noting that, "Good order, loyalty, proper conduct and orderliness are the hallmark of the military."
