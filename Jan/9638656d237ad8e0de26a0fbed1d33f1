Organized by the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), the Uganda film festival is back.The festival was launched on Wednesday during a breakfast dialogue in the presence of film industry stakeholders including actors, producers, writers and broadcasters, among others.The executive director of UCC, Godfrey Mutabaazi, said although the film industry has come a long way, there is still much to achieve. He added that many local filmmakers don't know they can still tell a good story in a local language."You shouldn't be forced to tell your stories in English," Mutabaazi said during the meeting at UCC offices in Bugolobi.Among the discussed issues was mapping the way forward for the industry since there was a reflection on lost opportunities on Queen of Katwe that was partly shot in South Africa."We need a body that can talk for film so that when a foreign project comes, they don't run around to UCC, gender ministry, URA and others," argued one attendant.It was then resolved that a film commission be formed. To implement the resolution, a meeting at UCC will be held among stakeholders within two weeks.The Uganda film festival earlier this year announced entries for the competition. Rewards await the winners.
