Kisumu gubernatorial aspirants, Jack Ranguma and Prof Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o have had a bitter row in recent days; now their daughters have been sucked into it.Just days after Prof Nyongo's, daughter, Lupita, publicly rooted for her father in an open letter posted as a video on Facebook, Governor Ranguma ' s daughter, Tanya, has responded in kind by dismissing the Oscar award winne's assertions.In the 2.49-minute-long video, which she posted on Facebook last Friday, Lupita made a passionate appeal to the Kisumu electorate to vote for her father on Monday, April 24, the day of ODM primaries in the county.&ldquo;I have witnessed the development Kisumu in terms of electricity spreading, schools being built, roads being constructed and medical facilities coming up. You (Prof Nyong&rsquo;o) have a lot to do with that &amp; &nbsp; I support your bid to be governor of Kisumu county We all know that there is a lot to be done but I know that Kisumu County will be a better place and leap into the future with you steering it, Lupita said in the open letter addressed to her father.This is what seems to have annoyed Ranguma's last born daughter, who has come out all guns blazing.PATHETIC RECORDTanya, who has also been living in the United States, and only recently returned to the country to campaign for her father, questioned Prof Nyongo's development records that Lupita so extolled in her video that has already drawn heavy criticism from the online community.Tanya further questioned the performance of Prof Nyong&rsquo;o during his stints as the MP for Seme and then Kisumu Rural Constituency saying the Senator did little to change the lives of Kisumu residents during that period.&ldquo;Based on her statements, Lupita should really be a Ranguma supporter, because the developments she has witnessed in Kisumu over the last few years are actually things that my father has done, without any help from Prof Nyong&rsquo;o,&rdquo; Tanya said on Sunday.She added: &ldquo;He (Prof Nyong&rsquo;o) also represented Seme in parliament for 20 years, and his development record according to CDF records was pathetic.&rdquo;Tanya described her father as a servant leader who only wants the advancement of all Kisumu residents. She at the same time accused Prof Nyong&rsquo;o of stifling development.
