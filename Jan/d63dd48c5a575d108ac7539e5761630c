Abuja &mdash; The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has dissociated itself from the recent alleged coup plot in the country.A statement by the Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Olatokunbo Adesanya in Abuja, pledge the allegiance of NAF to the Constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari.He said the plot linking its personnel to a coup was the handiwork of mischief-makers.Adesanya warned those contemplating a military takeover in this "21st Century," to note that it was no longer fashionable in the democratic nations of the world.The statement reads: "The attention of the Nigerian Air Force has been drawn to a mischievous allegation by an online media organisation of the NAF's involvement in the planning of a purported coup d'&eacute;tat to take over the reins of government."The NAF considers it most ridiculous that anyone in his right senses, could still be fixated on the possibility of effecting a change in government in the country outside the ballot box."The statement recalled the earlier pledge of loyalty by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar on May 18, 2017, while commissioning a new residential accommodation for its personnel at NAF Base, Bill Clinton Drive, AbujaAdesanya explained: "It is imperative to state that the earlier stance of the NAF on the unfortunate coup rumour has not changed."The NAF is a highly professional and apolitical service that is focused on ensuring the territorial integrity of the country, as well as facilitating a safe and secure environment for Nigerians to prosper while conducting their legal businesses."The strong belief of the NAF in democratic values was also demonstrated during the recent Gambian crisis. It was the first and only air force that deployed its fighter aircraft to ensure that the will of the Gambians was not subverted."Adesanya said this latest reaction became necessary because"It appears that some individuals with unknown intentions are bent on further spreading the malicious misinformation."
