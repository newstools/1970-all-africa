Sequel to the release of the video of his previously released banger entitled "For Life", Nigerian music sensation, Runtown, has released the official music video for his 2017 debut single.The song, which has garnered impressive reviews since it premiered, serves as a good follow up to his 2016 monster hit christened "Mad Over You".The self acclaimed "Sound god" like he is sometimes called, had his breakthrough in 2014 with the release of his groundbreaking record dubbed "Gallardo".Though surrounded by controversies at some point in his career, the singer has managed to remain highly relevant with back to back hits.Despite the fact that his recent tune, "For You" sounds a lot like "Mad Over You", fans have chosen to consciously ignore the obvious.The song was produced by fast rising Nigerian music producer, Krizbeatz, who is also responsible for quite a number of raving singles including Tekno's "Pana" and "Diana", Seyi Shay's "Weekend Vibes", Skales' "Temper", among others.The video was directed by Meji Alabi.
