Every year on May 21, people around the world celebrate culture the best ways they know how.For instance in Nigeria, the Oyo state government ordered students to dress in their traditional wear; some people on social media chose to write their posts in local languages, while others wrote poetry about their cultures.The main celebrations in Uganda were taking place at the Uganda National Cultural Centre (UNCC) on Sunday. Such days are characterized by culture dialogues that later grow into different traditional performances capped by the various exhibitions in the National Theatre gardens.But things were a little different this time; the celebration lacked the spark. In fact, it even went unnoticed for UNCC's closest neighbours, the performances were few and some looked hardly rehearsed and as opposed to the many exhibitors that usually showcase, this year attracted less than 10.Although only a handful of the exhibiters had authentic Ugandan cultural products, the bark cloth exhibition still stood out. The project looks at making bark cloth more functional especially in day-to-day things such as furniture, clothing and decoration.With different designs on the cloth, Emmanuel Waddimba, president of Uganda Visual Artists and Designers Association (UVADA) says, the art almost makes one forget that a bark cloth has been related to death most of the time. In many Ugandan cultures, dead bodies are wrapped in bark cloth for burial.Apparently, the poor turnout was due to the fact that the day was poorly publicized, a result of a low budget; sources said the organizers had only Shs 5m to put the entire celebration together.But the dialogue that started off the activities was enriching; panelists explored why Uganda needs an arts and culture ministry instead of lumping it under the ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development.During her speech, Afrigo band's front woman Joanita Kawalya asked government to remember that art and culture are not just a way of life, but contributors to the education and economic systems."Government, you should recognize the importance of music in the development of a country," she said.She later asked artistes to represent their cultures in what they do. The day featured performances by Halima Namakula and a troupe from Burundi.
