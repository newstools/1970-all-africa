Christian Chukwu writes that the newly inaugurated Port Harcourt Pleasure Park by the former Rivers State governor, Dr. Peter Odili will conserve foreign exchange for the country and attract visitors from across the world to the stateOn Saturday, May 27, 2017, former Rivers State governor, Dr. Peter Odili, led other prominent political and religious leaders from across Nigeria, to inaugurate the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park.The Pleasure Park is Nigeria's undisputed tourism destination, which was initiated and completed by the Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike-led administration to conserve foreign exchange for the country and attract visitors from across the world to Rivers State.The project was flagged off as part of the first year anniversary of the Wike administration. Since then, the project site has transformed from the neglected "construction site borrow pit" to an international leisure centre.Built by Julius Berger, the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park exudes beauty and serenity. It has a climbing tower, beautifully designed natural lake, sporting facilities, two five aside football fields, Mini Golf Course, intercontinental restaurants, kids play centres and mobile gyms.In his speech while inaugurating the park, Odili declared that that the people of Rivers State were proud of the accomplishments of Wike in the past two years.Praising the governor for delivering a world-class international park which will make the state a prime destination, the former governor prayed God to grant all the aspirations of the governor for living up to the expectations of the people.Odili said, "I have travelled to at least 26 countries, I have never seen anything like this. God will ensure that all your aspirations are realised."The Pleasure Park is on a massive expanse of land suiting for such purpose. Its architectural design and structural outlay are deliberately crafted. To make it best of its kind, and certainly so, it will afford patrons limitless space for walkout.People can also engage in other social but recreational activities of choice that are so provided. The approved architectural design has one thing in focus. That is, to give this iconic project a unique sale's appeal.Sharing same perimeter wall with the Port Harcourt Barracks of the sixth Division of the Nigeria Army popularly known as Bori Camp, the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park is located along the Port Harcourt-Aba Expressway.It is a novel model. An integrated facility it is and does have various features that will offer specific leisure treatment to patrons.Such active culture of life died in the eighties among residents of Rivers State. The few existing gardens do not have alluring appeal. To state the point bluntly, they do not exist any more. That is why the current effort of government is commendable. It strives to restore such lifestyle with a functional facility of such kind.This new park, which is rising to fame has a secured neighbourhood that assures of serenity. Everybody can access it from all parts of the city because of its centrality.Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Pleasure Park, Wike announced that a modern cinema will be constructed to complement the facilities at the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park.The governor stated that the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park will attract tourists to the state and also generate revenue for its maintenance.Speaking further, Wike, who said Odili was invited to inaugurate the project because of his position as a father figure in the state's politics since 1999, stated that all other elected governors of Rivers State either passed through or served the former governorHe said, "Omehia was a governor, he worked under him (Odili), Amaechi was a governor, he served him and I am a governor, I passed through him."Managing Director of Julius Berger, Wolfgang Goetsh, informed that the Wike-led administration initiated, supervised the project and made useful suggestions that ensured its beauty.To the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Chief Felix Obuah, expressed excitement and satisfaction over the construction of the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park by the Wike-led administration.Obuah, who described the facility as world class and the first of its kind on African continent, commended the governor's foresight in providing not only a tourist attraction in the state, but a leisure and recreational centre for families, friends, loved ones, fun seekers as well as games and sports enthusiasts from within and outside the state.He also described the initiative as exceptional and that, conceived out of the love the governor has for the people of the state, and his drive to boost the revenue base of the state as the park has the potential of generating huge revenue to aid the development of the entire state.Thanking the Wike for fulfilling his campaign promises and delivering on his mandate, through the construction of various projects across the state, the PDP chairman explained that providing the people with facilities like the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park will help unite families and homes and encourage sustainable peace as well as conducive environment for business and social life to thrive in the state.He therefore, stressed the need for members of the public to avail themselves of the opportunity the Port Harcourt Pleasure Park offers, saying the benefits cannot be estimated following the different kinds of state-of-the-art facilities available at the Park.Obuah however, called for maintenance culture by all users and handlers of both the indoor and outdoor facilities at the park, saying doing that would help sustain the beautiful and quality legacy put in place by the governor..Chukwu wrote in from Port Harcourt
