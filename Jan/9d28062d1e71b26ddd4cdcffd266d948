Nigeria joined the rest of the world yesterday to celebrate this year's global Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) Day, with aviation stakeholders lamenting shortage of personnel across the country.Vice president of the International Federation of Aeronautical Information Management (IFAIMA), Kabiru Yahaya Gusau, in Lagos called for the engagement of more personnel into its fold in order to boost operations at various stations.Gusau disclosed that the organisation lacked personnel as a result of aging workforce. He noted that the shortage of personnel has created a vacuum that needed to be addressed in order to enable them meet the changes in the system as it has transformed from AIS to Aeronautical Information Management (AIM).Gusau also called for the licensing of personnel of AIS, adding that this would enable personnel to take responsibility of any action, which would be traced to them while discharging their duties.AIS automation, according to him, would laid to rest the issue of sending Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) by paper but by electronic means.He added that the total radar coverage of Nigeria has greatly impacted on the Airspace but expressed the hope that with automation on board, the issues associated with radio communications will be a thing of the past.Gusau appealed to the Federal Government to ensure the implementation of the AIS automation as it has been approved in the budget to ensure safer skies.
