Nairobi &mdash; Business magnate Dr Chris Kirubi has advised African Governments to form regional airlines instead of having national carriers such as Kenya Airways.Dr Kirubi at the same time urged Kenya to do away with Kenya Airways and instead lobby for the formation of East Africa Airlines saying it would be more dynamic and of greater benefit to the region."There are very few African countries that have managed to have and operate a national carrier. Our countries are too small; the volumes of travels are too little, which cannot sustain the business," Dr Kirubi said."The United Emirates is a success story of this concept, the efficiency and success of United Emirates has opened up the UAE, a desert, to the world. Today Dubai is a leading destination owing to the success of Emirates."The industrialist further encouraged Kenya to adopt the open sky policy saying it would ultimately profit Kenya in terms of opening up the country to tourism and business."Kenyans need not be afraid of opening up its skies. On the contrary, the move would expand its market and also publicise the destination. You cannot close down the market just to allow an inefficient airline to run the space instead of opening the country to the world," Dr Kirubi, one of the major investors of Kenya Airways, said.At the same time, Dr Kirubi urged travellers to not feel obligated to opt to fly an airline that is deemed to be more expensive, for the purpose of promoting an airline.He threw the ball in KQ's court urging it to match other airlines by investing in its travel experience and services, failure to which would see the airline fail like dozens of other African airlines that have closed down.Kenya Airways has been plagued by high airfare, accompanied by high parking fees. The airline has also crashed into billions of losses for two years running with foreign airlines taking advantage of the situation.Dr Kirubi recommended the carrier to attract investors by creating a parking bay for private investors who land on private jets. This, he said, would see more decision makers, captains of industries and the elite class comes into Kenya easily with foreign investment financial cash flows.The industrialist was speaking during a flight tour organised by Dassault Falcon, a French private aviation company seeking to grow their market in Kenya.
