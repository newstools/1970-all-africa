We also agreed to support businesses in establishing stronger partnerships to grow the tourism industry in both countries."The importance of the relationship between government and business in the tourism industry can never be overemphasised. For tourism to thrive, governments need to forge a stronger collaboration with the industry," said Minister Xasa.The PPEM was inaugurated on Monday in Pretoria, and is an extension of the cordial and mutually beneficial relations between China and South Africa. The PPEM allows the two countries to exchange information and identify common objectives and strategies, and create opportunities for people in both countries to benefit from the sharing of social, cultural and economic capital across government, academia, business and civil society.The 'Discover Beautiful China' event, hosted by the CNTA, was held under the auspices of the PPEM on Monday.South Africa and China signed the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Tourism in October 2013.

While China houses the headquarters for the BRICS Development Bank in Shanghai, South Africa is home to its African regional offices.Minister Xasa said the Department of Tourism recognises that international cooperation in the area of tourism is emerging as an important foreign policy tool and an instrument of economic diplomacy in strengthening the broader bilateral relations between South Africa and China."We are committed to continue to implement other areas of cooperation identified in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2013 to increase two-way international tourism between our countries for mutual benefit."Tourism is much more than an economic driver - it is also a social unifier. It brings people together and it's about creating an experience - an authentic cultural experience," said the Minister.
