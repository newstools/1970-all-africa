Lagos &mdash; The Founder of Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has warned against any military takeover of government, vowing to lead a nationwide protest against any such act.Bakare who was the vice presidential candidate to Muhammadu Buhari in 2011 under the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) campaign of that year, also warned Nigerians to stop engaging in speculation over President Muhammadu Buhari's health."We don't want the military to return to power. I have said I will not participate in any protest again, but if the military dares return, I will personally mobilise all the forces in this country to hit the streets and protest. It is not a threat but a promise," Bakare said.Bakare said the civilian administration might be bad, it was still preferable because the military would only end up dragging the country back.He said President Buhari was on a sure part to recovery, and warned Nigerians to desist from speculating about his health.
