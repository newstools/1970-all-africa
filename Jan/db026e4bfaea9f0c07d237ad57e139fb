However, South African Emergency Departments and clinicians are advised to be on the alert for cases of fever and/or haemorrhagic symptoms amongst returning travellers from the area," the Department of Health said on Wednesday.South African Port Health authorities have been informed and continue to screen persons, who enter via airports, for fever.

The outbreak currently remains confined to Likati Health Zone.The DRC Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation and various partners are working closely to rapidly control the outbreak through strengthened epidemiological surveillance, and implementation of a comprehensive logistics plan including the deployment of teams comprising experts in epidemiology, clinical management, social mobilisation and risk communication.This is the eighth Ebola virus outbreak in the DRC since 1976. The last outbreak occurred in 2014 with 66 cases and 49 deaths.Ebola virus is transmitted following direct contact with persons infected with the virus - through contaminated body fluids including blood, stool, urine, saliva and semen, or with an environment contaminated with body fluids.Symptoms develop eight to 10 days after contact and include fever, weakness, myalgia, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, rash and bleeding from mucous membranes.
