Auldon Toys Limited, manufacturers of Unity Girl dolls, Nigeria&rsquo;s first theme dolls that project the Africa&rsquo;s cultural heritage, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Dufry Duty Free Limited, a global travel retailer with operations in 78 countries across the world.The partnership, which was sealed with both parties, will see Dufry sell Auldon&rsquo;s Toys across its outlets in all countries, where it operates, a move that both parties said will be mutually beneficial to all, going by their pedigree and individual commitment to quality.&ldquo;We are no doubt thrilled to be partnering Auldon Toys, a Nigerian wholly indigenous company in this venture as we are more than convinced about its prospect following its strong acceptability within and outside the Nigerian market. For some time, we followed with keen interest, its soaring popularity following the unprecedented success the Unity Doll made in all markets with its theme on unity, echoing beyond a product or service function, and carving a niche for itself as the symbol of positive values, and an icon of African culture. Little wonder, its target consumers now identify and freely relate to it, &ldquo;said Managing Director of Dufry Nigeria, John Hines.Hines also noted that Auldon Toys, particularly the Unity Dolls &ldquo;fit beautifully into the products we like to push across Africa and beyond.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is worthy to mention that we have had a couple of companies who have shown interest in having us market their product, but we declined because they don&rsquo;t meet up what we desire, but in the case of Auldon, we have seen a perfect match, &rdquo;he added.On his part, Managing Director of Auldon Toys, Mr. Paul Orajiaka, who said he was pleased with the partnership, acknowledged the strength and expertise of Dufry, adding the company is known across the globe.He stated that a partnership with a global brand of Dufry&rsquo;s repute is one that a leading brand like Unity Dolls and other toys under its stable, need to conquer other frontiers.He noted that Auldon is optimistic this first step will usher greater prospects to other Dufry stores across the globe.&ldquo;I am proud to say the level of Acceptance of these dolls and our other toys across the country, has been unprecedented. I can tell you because of a handful of reasons, namely; affordability, premium quality, availability, uniqueness and most importantly the educative value the dolls offer&rdquo;. &ldquo;So it is safe to say we are a market leader with strong prospect for increased growth. Currently, we distribute to all leading retail outlets and supermarkets across the country, namely Game, Shoprite, Spar, Next, Park n Shop, Sahad Stores, Ebeano among others.&rdquo;&ldquo;Our visibility level is very high and that&rsquo;s because there is a growing level of attachment between the dolls and our target market which is the girl child ranging from age 1&ndash;10 and the parents. At UnityDolls, we are enjoying a highly successful business operation in Nigeria and we&rsquo;re convinced it&rsquo;s time to make similar impact in other climes. And the best partner in actualising this plan is no other organisation than Dufry, &ldquo;Orajiaka said.&nbsp;
