The Association of Nigerian Exporters has kicked against external interferences in the regulation of the free trade zones.The director-general of the association, Prince Joseph Idiong, in a statement said exporters were rattled by the interference of outsiders in the administration of the free zones because the outsiders lacked the sensitivity needed to manage issues that affected free zone enterprises.Idiong stated that NAPIMS had no business fixing tariffs at the free zones as it was not the regulator of the zones.The exporters argued that it was the responsibility of the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA) to regulate the zones, including fixing tariffs.The association quoted Section 11 of the Oil &amp; Gas Export Free Zone Regulations 2003, which states that "The authority (meaning OGFZA) shall issue schedule of tariffs which shall apply in the Free Zone and which shall be reviewed from time to time and copies made available to the licensees or operators," while Section 32 (4) of the same regulation gives OGFZA the "right to review tariffs for operations in the Free Zone from time to time."
