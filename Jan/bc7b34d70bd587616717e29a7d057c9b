These include the Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. VHFs affect many organs, damage blood vessels, and affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease, but some, like Ebola or Marburg, cause severe disease and death.In 2012, a yellow fever epidemic spread in Darfur. According to the UN World Health Organisation it was "Africa's worst in decades". Between September and December, 732 cases of yellow fever were reported in Darfur, including 165 deaths.Several parts of Sudan were hit by haemorrhagic fever in 2014. The disease spread as well in Red Sea state, "but the state government and health authorities have imposed a blackout on the disease, which kills people in eastern Sudan on a daily basis," activists told this station in June that year.
