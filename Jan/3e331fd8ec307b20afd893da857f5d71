In a brand new eight-part series, renowned BBC World News presenter, Zeinab Badawi, travels to the land of her birth to discover some of Africa's most treasured history.The continent of Africa has a long, complex history, and its people built civilizations which rivalled those which existed anywhere else in the world. However, much of the continent's history is not widely known, and the little that is known often projects a distorted, partial picture.Sudan-born Zeinab travels to all four corners of Africa, interviewing historians, archaeologists, and citizens whose stories paint a vivid picture of their continent's past and how it informs their present lives."There is so much breadth and depth to Africa's history, but little of it is told by Africans. That's why this series is so important and so unique - it shapes perceptions of the continent and paints a picture that is very different to people's preconceived ideas in today's world," explains Badawi. "The old stereotypes are being challenged and a new, compelling narrative is being written."For eight weeks, beginning on the 1st July, History of Africa will air on BBC World News, every Saturday at 02:10 &amp; 15:10 GMT and every Sunday at 09:10 &amp; 21:10 GMT.
