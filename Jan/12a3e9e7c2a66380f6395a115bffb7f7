Awka &mdash; Acting President Yemi Osinbajo has blamed the increasing cases of agitations across the country on the failure of the political actors to deliver on the basic needs of the people, forcing the people to seek succor in their respective tribal groups.He said most agitations centered around failure of the state to create an inclusive society, guarantee the security of lives and property and failure to build a trust around the rule of law and judicial system.Speaking yesterday in Awka during the 50th Conference of the Nigerian Law Teachers Association on the theme, 'Law, Security and National Development,' at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Osinbajo said most of the security problems confronting the nation were self-inflicted by corrupt practices and injustices of various forms.While remarking that he started teaching law in 1981, Osinbajo described law teachers as custodians, thinkers and creators of the underlying concept and foundation premises of law.Earlier, Anambra State governor Willie Obiano, expressed worry over the rate 'criminals' were granted bail by lawyers, which he said had cost him much as 'the criminals keep on recycling.'On his part, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Joseph Ahaneku said there must be stability and order for development to thrive in any society.
