Now you'll get to experience the wilderness like never before. Kenya's Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in partnership with Virry VR, becomes the first wildlife area to feature on Virtual Reality, an experience that takes gamers on a virtual safari in the Kenyan savannah.The majority of people will never get the chance to see big wildlife in its natural environment. This is partly because of the cost and time it takes to get to the African bush, but also because of the significant threat that wild animals face from poachers - wild animal populations have plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012.On Tuesday, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Virryare announced the launch of Virry VRon PlayStation VR in the USA. This is the first virtual reality experience of its kind where gamers literally and virtually interact with real animals in their natural habitat, tempting lions with juicy slabs of meat, feeding fresh greens to elephants, stalking zebras, and sharing mud baths with rhinos.This collaboration will showcase Lewa to the world. Mike Watson, Lewa's CEO, hopes that this collaboration will ignite a passion for wildlife, an understanding of the plight of endangered species while giving gamers an opportunity to experience what it's like to be amidst these majestic creatures."Virry VR immerses players in the lives of real animals, encouraging discovery, empathy, and problem solving, while helping them to better understand nature, conservation, and the world around them," explains Virry and Fountain Digital Lab CEO, Svetlana Dragayeva.Filmed entirely on Lewa, the virtual reality creates a wildlife experience that is as close as you can get to being on an actual safari.Virry VR is available exclusively at the PlayStation Store in the "Experience" section.
