The All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said it received the news of the release of 82 Chibok schoolgirls with great joy.The party therefore urged President Muhammadu Buhari to be steadfast in his commitment to ensure the release of all the Chibok girls as well as others being held captive by the terrorists.In a statement issued yesterday by APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, the party described the feat as yet another evidence that President Buhari is fulfilling his promises."The party particularly commends President Buhari for his tenacity and dedication in ensuring the safe return of the Chibok girls who were abducted in 2014."This is further proof that we have a president who is working the talk. Nigerians will recall that last year, government secured the release of 20 girls. The APC also wishes to express its profound gratitude to all security organisations and international agencies that have played various roles to secure the release of the Chibok schoolgirls," it stated.The party hailed the girls for their bravery "having survived the very harrowing experiences in the past three years, and their parents and families who have endured the nervy and traumatic wait for their children."We assure you of the government resolve to give comprehensive medical attention to the released schoolgirls and ensure their rehabilitation and reintegration into the society."For parents and families whose children remain in captivity, we urge them to take solace with fact that government is doing everything possible to ensure the safe return of the remaining schoolgirls.
