Cape Town &mdash; Did nursing the disappointment of the SAMA awards lead to Babes Wodumo missing out on her U.S. visa?It seems like the popular singer will be watching the BET Awards from the comfort of her sofa as she is apparently struggling to secure her visa for America.The singer has been trending on social media because Wodumo and her manager-boyfriend Mampintsha are reported to have applied for their visas a little too late.The duo are supposed to attend the BET Awards in Los Angeles, where she is nominated in the Best International Act: Africa category. The ceremony is on Sunday, June 25.In a statement, the organisers of the BET Awards, Viacom International Media Networks Africa, said: "As Viacom International Media Networks Africa, we have assisted the 2017 BET Awards nominees in securing their travel requirements in a speedy manner.
