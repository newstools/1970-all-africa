Police dispersed Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company (Kiwasco) employees after they held protests threatening to evict their director from office.Business along the Oginga Odinga Street was paralysed as police engaged Kiwasco employees in running battles.The employees were joined by members of the Kisumu county government workers' union to demand for the resignation of Mr David Onyango, managing director..Customers who turned up to pay their water bills or seek other services had to scamper for safety during the morning melee.Initially the workers had converged at the City Hall, before marching along the street towards their offices.Police officers who were on standby at the entrance of Kiwasco offices, hurled teargas canisters at the employees as they scampered in different directions.County workers union secretary-general Rashid Ondu said there was need for the county government to address the grievances of the employees.There was however a faction of workers who distanced themselves from the demonstrations and supported the MD.Last week, the National Union of Water and Sewerage employees distanced itself from a planned strike by their members in Kisumu.The union released a statement indicating that it was consulting with its lawyers with a possibility of instituting contempt proceedings against Kisumu County Government Workers Union, who it accused of meddling in the affairs of their members in the region.In a letter addressed to Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma by the National Union's Secretary General Elijah Awach, the body vowed to resist any industrial action by their Kisumu members through the county government workers union.The county government union had issued Mr Ranguma a seven day notice to act upon grievances raised against KIWASCO or else they disrupt the company's services.Mr Awach indicated that they are the right body to represent unionized Kisumu employees having signed a recognition agreement in 2006, adding that the national body has a collective bargain agreement (CBA) with their Kisumu members signed and registered in September 2016.Mr Awach accused the Kisumu County Government Workers union of trying to encroach into KIWASCO in 2016, a matter, he said they registered with the employment and labor court in Kisumu and obtained a restraining order against them.The planned strike suffered had suffered a blow in November last year after Water Services Regulatory board Chief Executive Officer Robert Gakubia sided with the national union saying the county government workers have no framework for engagement in this matter.
