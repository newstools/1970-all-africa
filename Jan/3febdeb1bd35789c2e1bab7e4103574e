We are suspecting them to be members of the Boko Haram from Borno or Yobe State."The attacks have however paralysed business activities in Takum which is a commercial town while some of the residents, particularly Igbo traders and Fulani's were said to be leaving the town in droves for fear of further attacks.The Chairman of Ussa Local Government, Rimansikwe Hassan Karma, told journalists that the area would have been turned to a battle ground but for his timely intervention by pacifying the youths not to embark on reprisal attacks.Karma, who commended the youths for not taking the laws into their hands, promised that security agencies are putting machineries in place to bring the culprits to book just as he urged those fleeing the area to return back.The senator representing Taraba South, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, who raised the matter on the floor of the Senate yesterday under matters of urgent national importance, wondered why the activities of unknown gunmen have continued in the state without adequate response from the security operatives just as he disagreed that the attackers are Fulani herdsmen saying they are insurgents displaced from Borno state.Confirming the attacks, the Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), David Misel, said the information presently available to the command is still very sketchy just as he promised that the command would address the press on the matter.
