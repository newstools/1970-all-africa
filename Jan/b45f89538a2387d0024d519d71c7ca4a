Why are some people in northern Nigeria unhappy about federal restructuring? What did the heads of state of the East African Community decide at their summit, which ended yesterday in Tanzania? And where does South Africa stand globally in the provision of healthcare?Northern Nigeria is unhappy about plans for federal restructuring.According to the Lagos-based Guardian newspaper, the controversy continued at the weekend with two elder statesmen, Malam Tanko Yakassai and Chief Bisi Akande as well as former Nigerian ambassador to China, Olusola Onadipe expressing divergent positions on the matter.The persistence of the calls for restructuring requires a decisive move by all the citizens to resolve the issue amicably instead of allowing it to breed ethnic suspicion and hostility.In an interview with the Guardian, Yakassai says the north is uncomfortable with the idea of restructuring the country.He says northerners are suspicious that the motive is to deprive the north in two important areas - representation at the National Assembly and equitable revenue allocation, both based on population density and thus currently favourable to the north.Yakassai has called on those promoting the changes to be clear and honest about the implications of restructuring for all concerned.East African trading bloc agrees to talk to European UnionEast African leaders have agreed a common position on the economic partnership deal with the European Union, regional paper the East African reports.The summit meeting of heads of state of the East African Community, which ended in Dar es Salaam yesterday, accepted that Kenya should not be disadvantaged because it had already signed the agreement.The new chairman of the trading bloc, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has been asked to contact the EU with a view to bringing all member states into line.Currently only Kenya and Rwanda have signed the partnership agreement proposed by Europe.

That last assertion is vigoruously denied by several contributorsTough times ahead as ANC holds top table meetingLooking ahead to political events this week, the ruling ANC is scheduled to hold its first national executive committee meeting since the controversial cabinet reshuffle in March.BusinessDay says the meeting will take place against a background of growing protest over the state of the ANC and efforts by opposition parties to remove President Jacob Zuma through a vote of no confidence.On the economic front, South Africa is waiting to see whether another ratings agency will downgrade the country's sovereign credit status.Moody's said in April that the sovereign rating was at risk of a downgrade and its decision would be announced shortly.Moody's officials held talks with the Treasury and with business and labour leaders last week, ahead of the release of inflation figures for April, which are due out on Wednesday, and the Reserve Bank's decision on interest rates, to be announced on Thursday.
