The aim is to make it easier for people especially the youth to start and run their own business in light of the key issues and the policy challenges that youth entrepreneurship faces, he said.Speaking about the challenges that exist, Minister Bholah said that entrepreneurs need to innovate, be more productive and integrate value chains on the international platform.
