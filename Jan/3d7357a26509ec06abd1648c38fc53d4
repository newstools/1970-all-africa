When Apio Moro was announced as a performer at last month's Blankets and Wine fete, only a handful outside the organisers knew who she was.But after only minutes on stage, she had everyone listening, thanks to the crispness of her vocals on Obia. Apio has been around the industry, however, participating in musical contests, joining a famous girl group before finally going solo.Those who have been to Suzan Kerunen's Pearl Rhythm Stage Coach activations or Coutinho Kemiyondo's Aka Dope, know her well. Apio sings in Jopadhola and English, mostly with her acoustic guitar often backed up by a djembe.On Saturday, in what was supposed to be a small gathering in Kololo's Yasigi beer garden, she organized her first solo showcase, Up Close With Apio Moro, which turned into a singalong and Jopadhola lesson for many.She had promised a night where she would not only share her music but also tell us the inspiration behind the words - this she did; we realized she has a lot of soul.She will be releasing her 13-track album later this year but at Yasigi, she had an extended play CD of five songs that people were parting with; three of the songs on it were inspired by an ex-boyfriend that hurt her, and there are probably many more on the album. She says she wrote Obia as she was trying to write down the things she and the said ex had done together."Then I realized that all the things I was writing down were bad, but he was a fine guy."Other songs too like Kiisa and Ajok also come straight out of her love diary and particularly about the girl he replaced her with. But on other songs including Slave, she sings about her own evils like when she had turned into an alcoholic."The song was inspired by this one day when I bought my beer and I was wondering whether I should drink it or pour it."Her performances do not entail lots of energy; it is actually her contrast that strikes. Apio comes across as one oblivious of her immense talent, through her vocal prowess and ability to effortlessly hit high notes are what make Apio a talent to look out for.
