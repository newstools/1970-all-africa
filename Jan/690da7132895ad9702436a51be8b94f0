London &mdash; Development of new and combined sensors with real-time and continuous monitoring will expand growth opportunities, finds Frost &amp; Sullivan's Measurement &amp; Instrumentation teamThe need for optimal safety, high yield, and combustion value to ensure process integrity is spurring double-digit growth and adoption of humidity and moisture sensors. Maintaining correct moisture ratios stimulates higher yields in chemical and petrochemical industry sectors, while the control of moisture levels in fuel gases and fuel oils helps ensure required combustion values and avoids explosive reactions. Humidity &amp; moisture sensors are based on eleven different contact and non-contact technologies which are application dependent. However, the absence of a single technology with multiphase application capability, and a lack of common standards are hindering market growth."The main competitors are from the automation and instrument manufacturing sectors. Market leaders are all industrial process automation and control device manufacturing companies. Early adopter GE and its subsidiaries dominate the humidity and moisture sensors market with emerging tunable diode laser (TDLAS) non-contact technology," said Frost &amp; Sullivan Measurement &amp; Instrumentation Industry Principal Dr. Rajender Thusu. "Other innovative companies, such as Silicon Laboratories, BAPI, TRANE, Honeywell, Amprobe, and Delmhorst Instrument Co, have developed a large range of humidity, moisture and temperature combination sensors."Global Humidity and Moisture Sensors Market, Forecast to 2023, recent analysis from Frost &amp; Sullivan's Test &amp; Measurement Growth Partnership Subscription, finds that the global humidity and moisture sensors market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 per cent from 2016 to 2023. The research analyses current and future technologies and trends in the global humidity and moisture sensors market for diverse process and discrete applications.
