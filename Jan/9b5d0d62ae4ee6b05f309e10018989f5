Kampala &mdash; The European Union together with Monitor Publications Ltd yesterday launched a children's comic series that will be running every Tuesday in the newspaper's children's magazine, Rainbow.The comics will promote reading, tourism and human rights among primary school going children who are the target audience of the Rainbow magazine.While signing the contract yesterday, Mr Kristian Schmidt, the head of European Union in Uganda, said the partnership is about helping children to discover Uganda through the adventures of Tesa and Luuka who travel to various parts of the country meeting different people and sharing entertaining stories."I have been to Uganda for four years but still meet Ugandans who have never been to these places. These are travel stories in series that also bring out issues of child rights. It is a good way to send a message," he said adding that this year, European Union is celebrating 60 years since inception and the theme of the celebrations focuses on youth."We came up with these two characters [Tesa and Luuka] and we hope that these two faces are recognised by young Ugandans," he said.Mr Tony Glencross, the managing director of Monitor Publications Ltd (MPL), said the comic is a serialized four page magazine inserted in Rainbow magazine which will add value to the readers and will run for seven weeks.In the last week, the entire comic will be reproduced and stitched together into a magazine that will be inserted into the newspaper."We want to give benefits to our readers, this is something that is exciting and it will take children to places like Source of the Nile and Bujagali in Jinja and other places," he said.Mr Charles Bichachi, the Executive Editor MPL, said the comic is equivalent to the travel stories of Mr Mutabingwa's family which were published in primary school English textbooks in 1970s and '80s and were used to explain the geography of East Africa."It gives students a sense of imagination when they go to places such as Jinja and Kasese. The newspaper is now an important tool of education, it comes at a cheaper cost than textbooks. This comic sits in a good product, Rainbow, and will certainly make a difference to our young readers," he said.
