The African Development Bank (AfDB) brought together more than 180 stakeholders across the off-grid energy sector on Tuesday, March 28, in the context of "Energy Week" at the Bank's headquarters in Abidjan to discuss interventions to support the scale-up of energy access investments. The overarching objective was to unleash an "Off-Grid Energy Revolution", to provide up to 75 million households and businesses not covered by the power grid with modern, clean and affordable electricity using decentralized solar technologies.
