This great achievement has been possible through mentorship and support from our colleagues at the Lancet Group of Laboratories in Kenya and South Africa", said Mr Nassor Ali, the country general manager for Lancet Laboratories in Tanzania."I'm proud of my fellow Tanzanians in the Lancet team who have had a steep learning curve and worked tirelessly to get us where we are today."Mr Mohamed Jaldesa who is regional technical manager for Lancet Group of Laboratories in Tanzania explained that the accreditation process started the day one the lab was set up.A ceremony to celebrate the accreditation is being planned by the Lancet Tanzania team, which will be graced by the consultant pathologist group managing director for East Africa, Dr Ahmed Kalebi.At the moment, Lancet's referral lab branch in Regency Hospital is undergoing final stages of internal audit and scheduled for external audit by SADCAS later in the year, after which other laboratories including in Arusha, Moshi, Dodoma and Zanzibar will follow suit.
