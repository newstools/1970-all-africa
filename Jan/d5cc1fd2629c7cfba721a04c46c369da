By midnight, the fund had a total of Shs 20M. Lubega spoke highly of the deceased, saying he was a pillar in their business and that they have lost a very big client in Ivan Semwanga."Ivan Semwanga can never be replaced. He was a one of a kind client, individually and as Rich Gang. We have hosted the Rich gang party for a very long time and those who have always attended can witness that he was one of our biggest customers. We are really going to miss him," Lubega said.Many of the friends, relatives and well-wishers gathered at the vigil shared his sentiments and expressed solidarity with the family. Among those were Godfrey Kirumira, Bad Black, Jose Chameleon, Ragga Dee, Jack Pemba and Nabila Naggayi among others.
