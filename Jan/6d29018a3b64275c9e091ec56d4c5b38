Asaba &mdash; The Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) has said that the directive by Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, (NERC) to consumers not to pay estimated billings only applies to Maximum Demand, (MD), customers and not residential.Mr. Azu Obiaya, Executive Officer of ANED, told Journalists in Asaba that the MD customers are commercial and industrial levels of electricity and contribute substantially to the revenues of distribution companies.The consumption threshold for MD customers is 45KVA. MD meters are connected on the 11kv (High tension wire) electricity lines, mostly on dedicated transformers. The customers include heavy users of electricity like commercial business plazas, large firms, and small-scale industries among others.NERC had, in June 2016, issued a directive to distribution companies for all MD customers to be metered by November 30, 2016. Following the expiration of the deadline, NERC further directed that MD customers not metered by March 1 should not pay any electricity bill presented by a distribution company on the basis of estimated billing methodology.It also said that no distribution company should disconnect any MD customer that was not metered by March 1, on the basis of a refusal to pay a bill issued after the compliance deadline on the basis of estimated billing method.
