As businesses, investors and policy makers in Africa look to make evidence-based decisions on where to invest, which firms to partner with, and how to target consumers, data is critical. Good data on Africa is hard to find though. This panel will discuss how data is collected and analyzed on the continent and how business and governments can utilize it to communicate, drive growth and support development.Moderator Carolyn Campbell, Founding Partner and Managing Director, Emerging Capital PartnersPanelists:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Greg Cohen &ndash; Co-Founder and Executive Director, Asoko Insight Daniel Ngwepe, Head of Government Relations for Sub-Saharan Africa, Visa, Inc.
