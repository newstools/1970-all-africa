For now let's focus on their wellbeing, arrival and the welcome ceremony," he said.The school sent a curriculum to the US so that the students can receive private tutelage and catch up with their peers after returning home.Speaking to journalists yesterday, Singida South MP and co-chair of Siouxland Tanzania Education Ministries (Stemm) Lazaro Nyalandu said the whole treatment and transport bill reached $800,000 (Sh1.7 billion). "It has been an expensive endeavour, but all of it has come from good Samaritans in the US. The air journey alone reached $300,000, its way expensive we could not have afforded it on our own," he said.The children were directly transported to US by a private plane owned by Samaritan Purse, and they are using the same plane for their return journey.
