Ughelli &mdash; Ex-Militants&nbsp;under the Federal Government's Amnesty Scholarship programme, yesterday, lamented their unpaid monthly allowances for a period of five months.The ex-militants, through one of their leaders and president, Niger Delta Peace Yoke-Leadership Initiative, Yerindideke Toriomo, also decried the payment of non-academic ex-militants while those on various scholarship programmes in different universities in the country were exempted.Applauding Acting President Yemi Osinbajo on his visit to the Niger Delta, the ex-militants said: "It has become a reoccurring decimal that in paying the allowances of ex-militants, those of us who have embraced intellectual welfarism through the amnesty scholarship programme are always left out."This has negatively affected our quest for knowledge in our educational pursuits, thereby affecting the academic success of the amnesty programme."It is in line with this that we are appealing to the acting president and the office of the Special Adviser to the President on Amnesty, Gen. Paul Boroh (retd), to expedite action by ensuring that the allowances of beneficiaries under the amnesty scholarship programme are paid."
