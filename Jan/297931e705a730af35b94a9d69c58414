U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross delivered the keynote address encouraging U.S.-Africa bilateral trade agreements. &ldquo;The critical question that decision makers in Africa, including many of you, must ask is this: As these upward growth trends continue, with what types of partners do you want to collaborate?&rdquo; said Sec. Ross during his keynote remarks, &ldquo;I believe that, the more African nations partner with U.S. businesses, the better off both the United States and Africa will be.&rdquo; Sec. Ross stressed the importance of bilateral trade agreements over larger multilateral agreements and the Trump administration&rsquo;s stance on compliance with eligibility requirements for agreements such as&nbsp;AGOA.Other speakers including President&nbsp;Filipe&nbsp;Nyusi&nbsp;called for greater U.S. investment and partnership in and with Africa, but President&nbsp;Nyusi&nbsp;stressed the need for diverse investors in industries such as tourism and agribusiness. &ldquo;It easier to enumerate what is not grown in my country rather than list what is produced. Mozambique can almost grow everything,&rdquo; said President&nbsp;Nyusi. &ldquo;We urge and encourage the American business people to take advantage of the enabling business environment, and investment opportunities and potential that exist in Mozambique to diversify their interventions.&rdquo;The&nbsp;AfDB&nbsp;President, Dr.&nbsp;Akinwumi&nbsp;Adesina&nbsp;also emphasized the importance of U.S.-Africa partnerships. Dr.&nbsp;Adesina&nbsp;pushed for the U.S.-Africa business relationship to go beyond trade, to investment. &ldquo;Africa offers you all &lsquo;The Deal of the Century&rsquo;, and America should not be left behind,&rdquo; said Dr.&nbsp;Adesina. &ldquo;Think of a continent where household expenditures will rise to $1.4 trillion in the next three years. Think of the continent where business to business investments will rise to $3.5 trillion in the next eight years. Think of the continent where the population by 2050 will be the same as India and China taken together today. Think of the continent that will brim with huge demand from a rising youth population that will reach 840 million by 2050, all buying and owning consumer products.&rdquo;As the leading U.S. business association solely focused on U.S.-Africa trade and investment, the sessions at&nbsp;CCA's&nbsp;biennial signature event - the U.S.-Africa Business Summit - primarily featured private sector solutions and how public sector actors could support business through an enabling environment. More than 140 speakers including leading private sector executives across&nbsp;CCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;core sectors discussed challenges and opportunities related to the theme of the conference."The Summit provided one of the first opportunities and an excellent platform for African leaders, U.S. and African CEOs and other stakeholders to engage with the Trump Administration on the important issues impacting the U.S.-Africa economic relationship" said&nbsp;Florie&nbsp;Liser,&nbsp;CCA's&nbsp;President and CEO.Regional integration on the continent was also a strong underlying theme throughout the Summit.&nbsp;ECOWAS&nbsp;President H.E.
