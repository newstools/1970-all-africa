It is now eight months into the country's state of emergency, imposed in October 2016 to crush the biggest protests in 25 years. The unrest started in the Oromia region in 2015 when the largest ethnic group, the Oromo, hit the streets demanding more rights. Demonstrations then spread to the Amhara region, home to the second major ethnic group.
