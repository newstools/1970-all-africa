The vision of this broadband strategy has been to see the transformation of the country to a knowledge-based society driven by a high capacity nationwide broadband network.The overall objective of this strategy is to provide quality broadband services to all citizens."The strategy has enabled the government to roll out the National Optic Fibre Broadband Infrastructure that has linked all the counties to the Internet by fibre cable. Fibre cable ground installation and provision of 4G network coverage has contributed to the high speeds and efficiency in connectivity," Joseph Mucheru, the Kenya's Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Information said.Access to fast and reliable internet has the potential to generate enormous social economic benefits for the country.
