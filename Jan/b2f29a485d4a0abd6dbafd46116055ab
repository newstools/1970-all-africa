President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has congratulated Grand Duke Henri on Luxembourg's national day.Luxembourg's National Day is celebrated on June 23, and is considered the official birthday of the Grand Duke although no Grand Duke or Duchess has ever had a real birthday that fell on this day, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement.The Grand Duchess Charlotte, who ruled Luxembourg from 1919 to 1964, was born on January 23, 1896, but the celebrations were shifted to June to take advantage of more favorable weather.The day was made a national holiday in 1941, and the date of June 23 was fixed by Ducal decree in 1961.President Sirleaf, in her message, recognized with gratitude, "the rewarding relations our two nations and peoples continue to enjoy, apparent by the high level visit of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Grand Duchy to Monrovia in March 2012."She recalled that the visit enabled the signing of two cooperation agreements for improvement in security at the Roberts International Airport and building the capacity of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.She further told Grand Duke Henri that her government remains hopeful that these agreements will be fully implemented to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, which both nations strive to fully implement.
