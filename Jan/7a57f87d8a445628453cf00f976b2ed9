In Jesus name the floods do not take my car anywhere," said in the video that he took of the incident.The video that he posted and then circulated on various WhatsApp groups showed a black Toyota Surf in the middle of the floods already over the tires size going up with praying aloud.He has told The Citizen that he believed God could save his car and recalled a verse in the Bible, Jeremiah 33:3 that says 'Call to me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know'.The video received 416 comments and 270 re-shares.
