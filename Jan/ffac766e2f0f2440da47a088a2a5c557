Johannesburg &mdash; Global superstar, Akon, is among the nominees for the African Utility Week Industry Awards to be conferred in Cape Town South Africa later this month.The Senegalese-American singer, rapper, songwriter, businessman, record producer and actor is nominated for the Outstanding Contribution Award: Power, for his Akon Lighting Africa, which is benefitting various countries in the continent.Five other finalists are vying for the award. Akon Lighting Africa is premised on the fact 600 million Africans still do not have access to electricity, particularly in rural areas. In far too many parts of Africa, night-time economic activities are practically non-existent.Launched in February 2014 Akon, philantropist Thione Niang and entrepreneur Samba Bathily, this initiative aims to develop an innovative solar-powered solution that will provide African villages with access to a clean and affordable source of electricity. Meanwhile, finalists for this year's African Utility Week Industry Awards have been announced.The final selection has a distinctly feminine feel with an all women cast and a strong line-up of ladies amongst the finalists for the coveted awards for leading energy and water professionals.
