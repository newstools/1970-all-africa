Fresh from snubbing the funeral of his spokesperson's wife and consigning popular Chimurenga musician Cde Chinx to the less glorious liberation war hero status, President Robert Mugabe Wednesday flew out again, this time to Botswana for the burial of Sir Ketumile Masire.Masire, who died last week, is expected to be buried on Thursday.President Mugabe, never one to assign any of his deputies on foreign trips, will be among dozens of foreign dignitaries at the solemn occasion.Media reports from Botswana say the nomadic Zimbabwean leader was expected among the dignitaries who include former South African leader Thabo Mbeki, former Mozambique President Armando Guebuza, former OAU secretary general Salim Ahmed Salim and former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.Since the death of Masire, Mugabe has not yet offered any public condolence message to the Batswana.But in 2013, he offered his condolence message to the Masire family following the death of the late Botswana leader's wife and one time first lady Olebile Masire.Back home, Mugabe has infuriated his people through his giant travelling bill in a country battling massive unemployment and poor social services, among other economic ills now associated with the troubled country.His spokesperson George Charamba has defended his endless travels insisting "diplomacy does not come cheap".But Charamba was soon to discover the insensitive side of his boss after the Zimbabwean leader and his wife stayed away from his (Charamba) own wife's funeral wake last month.Mugabe was soon to disappoint again when he declared Chingaira a liberation war hero, going against strong public sentiment the Chimurenga music chanter deserved the highest honour of the land.He also did not attend Chingaira's funeral.
