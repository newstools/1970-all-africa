Jocular Kawempe North Kampala Capital City Authority councillor Muhammad Ssegirinya has today perfected the 'bush prayers', a tradition started by his comrade-in-comical politics Mubarak Munyagwa (FDC, Kawempe South MP).In an early morning video, Mr Ssegirinya is seen in the company of other individuals wearing the traditional Muslim men head gear, absorbed in prayers cursing tormentors of Uganda's overseas labourers.Mr Munyagwa controversially made the infamous "edduwa ya Kamulali," translated to mean the hot pepper supplication, where he burnt the choking plant, praying amid the fuming smoke.His student Mr Ssegirinya has instead replaced pepper with salt, asking God to descend his wrath on the Arab employers whom he accuses of torturing Ugandan employees.Recently, Mr Ssegirinya claimed to have travelled to the United Arab Emirates, where he commiserated with Ugandans he said are under-going extreme abuse and exploitation.When Mr Munyagwa said his hot pepper sprayer last year, it earned him a shouting match with the Kibuli based Muslim establishment spokesperson Sheikh Nooh Muzaata.Mr Ssegirinya organized his controversial prayer to coincide with the International Labour day celebrations, which he said was unnecessary to celebrate in Uganda given what he termed as the suffering endured by Uganda's workers in Middle East.Dr Abdulhafiz Walusimbi, a Sharia expert at the Islamic University in Uganda dismissed Mr Ssegirinya's duwa as having no legal basis in Islam."Such kinds of duwa are not acceptable in Islam because the Prophet Muhammad's way of supplication was very normal, this salt duwa has no legal basis in Islam," he said.He added that the method employed by the cheeky politician is "intimidating but illegal."The acting chairperson of Uganda Association of External Recruitment Agencies (UAERA), Ms Lillian Keene Mugerwa, recently told the Parliamentary Committee on Gender that up to 65,000 Ugandans are doing odd jobs in the Middle East.This is 15,000 higher than the number that was working there one year ago.Most of them are working as either cleaners, waiters/waitresses, drivers, tailors, construction and factory workers or security guards."Their annual contribution in the form of remittances is $400,000," said Ms Mugerwa.UnemploymentDue to unemployment in Uganda, some of the Ugandans now working in countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, sold family property to finance their travel to the Middle East.Many Ugandans have been made to believe that the 'returns' there would be higher than they would ever make in Uganda.In January 2016, the government banned the export of maids. The ban came on the heels of reports that many Ugandan workers were being mistreated by their Saudi Arabian employers.According to Action Aid (2012), six in every 10 Ugandans are unemployed. Some lack the skills employers need. In other cases, the economy is not expanding as fast as the labour force.
