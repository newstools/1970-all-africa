KCB bank has sourced up to Shs 38bn in credit lines from the European Investment Bank, which it intends to channel to small and medium enterprises, the bank announced in a statement.This credit facility comes with a cheaper interest rate over a fairly longer period of time compared to the usual loan products.Through this credit facility, KCB is able to lend from Shs 50 million to Shs 1 billion over five to seven years, with the money lent to specific sectors. The bank said "the credit line will be available to sectors across all the SMEs with the exception of areas such as tobacco, military equipment and mining."Mathias Muhimbisa, the executive director KCB Bank Uganda, said "small and medium enterprises will benefit from the reduced interest rate for fairly long-term borrowing of five to seven years and tailor-made SME workshops covering the vital must-knows of SME management."KCB says it targets to lend money to more than 380 SMEs across the country. By its estimates, KCB plans to lend out Shs 100 million on average."This, therefore, extends our currentfoot print across the SME sector as we avail the much-needed funding to the segment to ensure economic growth," Muhimbisa said.
