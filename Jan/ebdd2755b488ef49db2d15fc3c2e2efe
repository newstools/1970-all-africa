Sokoto &mdash; Sokoto State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Saturday urged the state government, to urgently relocate some markets in the metropolis to the outskirts to decongest over-population in the areas. This was contained in a communiqu&eacute; signed by the Secretary of the Council, Abdullahi El-Kurebe.According to the communique, the relocation of the markets became necessary so as to improve adequate water supply and reduce congestion in the Sokoto metropolis. The NUJ to this end, called on the state government, to create access roads and provide more public toilets; fence the vegetable markets at "ramin kura" as well as provide more drainages to allow free flow of water around the areas."The meeting noted that there are too many markets within Sokoto metropolis and recommends that the state government urgently relocates some markets to the outskirts to decongest over-population in the area. "The meeting observed that while almost all sorts of foods are sold in Gandu area and several markets, with very minimal hygienic consideration, the location of timber market, welders, blacksmiths and grinding machines are hazardously located at the same area."Also, burnt tyres and public toilets in the same area create air pollution while stagnant waters are visible and breeding mosquitoes, creating unhygienic environment for the people in the area. "This is because of the existence of abattoir in the area, meat is conveyed to selling points in very unhygienic manner, which calls for the need for government to provide meat-conveying vehicles to sale points," the communique read.The communique called on the people of Gandu area as well as other places to embrace the spirit of environmental cleanliness; cooperate with government on its programmes as well as keep vigilance on all government facilities provided to the area.
