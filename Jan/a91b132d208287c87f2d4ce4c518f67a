Kampala &mdash; An enhanced media experience characterised by radio and television on the same platform is the latest offering from Nation Media Group (NMG) media houses Dembe FM and Spark TV.Dubbed Dembe Spark Hybrid, the collaboration, which according to Ms Aggie Konde, the NTV managing director, is a response to consumer insight, will see a programme on Dembe FM aired live on Spark TV."Our customers are mobile in their consumption of media, therefore we opted to champion in providing seamless broadcast across all our platforms so they can consume the media simultaneously," she said."With Spark TV already rated as the number two local station, this will add value proposition to advertisers on both Spark and Dembe and give value to our audiences," she added.Twezimbe, Dembe FM's morning show from 6am to 9am, presented by Shafiq Kaima, Isaac Katende, popularly known as Kasuku, and Ruth Kalibbala, is now broadcast live on Spark TV."When you look at radio, there have been a number of changes that have taken place due to digital migration. We want to move with the audience. We want to give them a two in one experience because there are those who have television sets and no radios and those that have radios but with no television sets. We want to tap them from both ends," said Moses Katongole, the programmes controller at Dembe FM.Both Ms Konde and Mr Katongole highlighted that this move is in line with the NMG policy of digital first.While commenting about the new innovation, Monitor Publications Managing Director Tony Glencross said: "This is an excellent innovation with our sister company. We are excited with the product and look forward to good audience growth and TV and radio."The package will thus increase consumer's infotainment experience given that Spark TV is available on Vid TV that can be watched on Android and IOS.
