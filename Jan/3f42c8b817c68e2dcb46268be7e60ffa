The Permanent Presidential Music Commission will establish performing arts and equipment centres in the country's eight regions.The announcement was made by the commission's director Donald Otoyo during the closing ceremony for the 12-day ninth national youth talent development programme in music and dance at Mombasa Beach Hotel today.The studios will be in Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Kakamega, Nyeri, Embu, Garissa and Mombasa."The centres will go a long way in helping budding musicians who have no access to equipment and other resources," Dr Otoyo said, adding that a lot of talent was being lost due to lack of exposure and professional nurturing.GLOBAL SHOWSDuring the event, 80 participants from all over the country were given tips on how to develop their talents.At the end on the training, the young people presented their pieces.The stage and open air auditorium were prepared by course directors Charles Muthini and Danson Siminyu.In the audience were parents, teachers, government officials and other invited guests.Sports and Culture Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario said similar training had been held in almost every region of Kenya."This programme has made the ministry proud. Young people can now talk of success," Dr Wario said."It is worth noting that some of those who have been trained are performing in various groups such as Kipawa Kenya, Hybrid Sounds and Ni Sisi Band while others have taken part in shows like the 2011 Crimea International Music Festival in Ukraine.BEST VOCALISTSThe minister thanked the commission for promoting talent."Many have attempted to write and record music but standards are usually low. They do not have the knowledge and end up giving up," Dr Wario added.Participants formed temporary bands, which performed during the ceremony.Some performers were outstanding. Zaina Salim and Sylvian Omache were some of the best vocalists while Joe Ng'ang'a stood out with his reggae style execution.Boniface Mboga Moi -- a blind student from Vihiga County -- also thrilled the audience with his voice.Jeremiah Mwanza and Alidinoh Ligawa got a standing ovation with their drumming while Boaz Areri Mogeni and Abraham Kiptanui captivated the audience with their guitar-playing skills.Others in the guitar category were Charles Charo, Erick Koome, Zacheus Mwendwa, Stephen Masai, Millicent Tsisika and Josephat Nyangoro.
