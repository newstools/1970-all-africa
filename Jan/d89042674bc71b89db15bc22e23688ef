I believe in the near future, more and more Chinese companies will invest and do businesses in Rwanda," he said.He said that the launch of the organisation is an occasion to look beyond the horizons so that the alumni plays more important role in sustaining the vitality of Rwanda-China bilateral cooperation."At present, we stand at a fresh start for China-Rwanda relations.
