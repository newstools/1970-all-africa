Ugandans in the diaspora have been cautioned to use every opportunity available to them to market the country as an investment and tourism attraction.The call was made by the special Presidential assistant on diaspora issues, Ms Florence Kiremerwa while speaking at the trade and investment conference held in West Bromwich, London, last week."Many of us here have over the years established very crucial networks, and friends whom we can entice into investing in our motherland. We may have to educate and lure our friends and work companies into investing in Uganda. The burden is now upon us to entice these networks and friends to seize this opportunity and make Uganda their next agri-business; tourism and investment destination," she said.Ms Florence cited the establishment of the one stop centre by Uganda Investment Authority as part of the many initiatives by government to ease the cost of doing business in the country.Mr Daniel Nsaba Buturo, the organiser of the event, took the mantle of bring the first 50 investors to the country between October and December this year, he also promised to make this convention an annual event and spread it all over the United Kingdom Cities."The First Uganda - Midlands, UK Trade and Investment Convention was a great success that has created an environment in the Midlands, UK that is conducive for a successful two way relationship between Uganda and the Midlands, UK. The considerable interest in the Ugandan economy that has come out of the Uganda - Midlands Convention has resulted in a trade mission to Uganda planned for the end of this year, 'he said.Mr Jaffer Kapasi, Uganda honorary consular general for Midlands, who was born in Masindi District, said that Uganda is in his heart and he would do all possible to see that trade between UK and Uganda is boosted.Mr David Smith, the Chairman for the British African Business Alliance commended the organisers of the event, adding that it will create awareness as many "British companies would want to do business with diaspora, but they do not know the diaspora exists."
