Yola &mdash; Two female suicide bombers on Monday blew themselves up in Tsamiya village in Madagali area of Adamawa State.Residents said the teenage girls sneaked into the village but did not reach their targets as some hunters intercepted them.The Secretary General of the Adamawa branch of the Nigeria Hunters Association, Garba Tarfa, told newsmen in Yola, "Our men spotted them around Tsamiya area trying to enter the town but when they were shouted at to stop with guns pointing at them, one of them decided to detonate her bomb and they both died."Tarfa attributed frequent attacks in the remote villages to lack of military presence, calling on the authorities to deploy adequate number of soldiers to the Madagali area."There is no military presence in remote villages of Madagali and the insurgents are cashing on that to launch attacks from time to time. Last week they attacked Wagga village where we repelled them and captured three of them who were brought to Yola," Tarfa said.The &lrm; Army spokesperson at the 28 Task Force Battalion in Mubi, Major Badare Akintoye, said he did not know of the incident.
