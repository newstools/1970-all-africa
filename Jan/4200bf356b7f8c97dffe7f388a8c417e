"Two peoples that are linked together by an unbreakable bond of suffering, that have persevered despite the pain and horror of the past; two small countries in size, facing numerous external challenges, that have yet managed to build a modern and developed country which serves as a model for progress," he said.In his address, Amb. Joseph Rutabana the Rwandan envoy to Israel, said the period of commemoration, it is an occasion to remember the lives that were lost, show solidarity with survivors and unite to ensure genocide never happens again in Rwanda or anywhere else.Rwanda today offers a story of hope; how a country and its people can stand strong in the face of adversity and together build a new and united society and restore the nation's spirit, he said, adding that it is also a chance to learn about Rwanda's story of reconciliation and nation building.He expressed hope that the international community drew lessons from its inaction during the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and asked that proper mechanisms be put in place to detect and prevent any other similar situation anywhere before calamities of such magnitude are committed.Amb. Rutabana later led the audience to the lighting of candles in remembrance of the victims of the Genocide against the Tutsi.
