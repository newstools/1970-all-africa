Wildfires have resulted in more than 10,000 people being evacuated from Knysna on the Garden Route in the Western Cape. Non-governmental organisation Gift of the Givers diverted bottled water meant to alleviate drought in Cape Town to assist in battling the blaze while National Defence Force spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobhozi said helicopters would help by dropping loads of water on the blazes.
