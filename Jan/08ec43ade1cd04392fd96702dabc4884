Our team is on the ground now.&rdquo;According to Pandanguo headman Adan Golja, gunshots were heard coming from the police post at around 5.30am, forcing villagers to run for their lives.IEDSThe number of casualties is unknown.The attack comes barely two weeks after eight people, including four police officers and four pupils, died when a Rapid Border Patrol Unit (RBPU) vehicle they were travelling in ran over a landmine in Ota, Lamu East.The attack was also blamed on the Somalia-based ragtag militia that is said to be based in the expansive Boni Forest.While the militants fighting to establish an Islamic caliphate in Somalia have not been claiming the attacks, police have linked them to their sympathisers.
