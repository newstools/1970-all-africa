Bruce Itahiwacu, popularly known as Bruce Melody, landed in Nairobi a few days ago where he will spend seven days recording music with Khaligraph Jones, a Kenyan-based recording artiste who also featured on CNN's African Voices recently.While people all over social media platforms are excited for Rwanda to participate in this year's edition of Coke Studio Africa, some are still wondering why and how Bruce Melody was chosen.We haven't found out how, but what's clear is that Coca-Cola Central, which is the producer of this show, selects the artistes whose music catalogue appeals to the youth, are talented, want to grow their profile beyond their home countries and are interested in both collaborating with another artiste.Coke Studio will last for a period of 12 weeks, but Bruce will spend seven days recording and shooting music videos with Khaligraph Jones, and other music participants. All the music videos will be aired everyday across 25 countries in Africa. The show has attracted some of the big names in the world. In the past, big names like Wyclef Jean, Ne-Yo, and Trey Songz have also been guest artistes of the studio. Congratulations are in order.
