Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has appointed an ad-hoc independent tribunal that will process appeals opposing the results of the Health Ombudsman's probe into the deaths of more than 100 psychiatric patients. The Ombudsman found that the patients, who were transferred from the Life Healthcare Esidimeni facility, died of starvation and dehydration while under the care of unlicensed NGOs.
