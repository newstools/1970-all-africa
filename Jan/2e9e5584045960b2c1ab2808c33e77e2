London &mdash; Harambee Stars skipper Victor Wanyama received immense praise from friend and foe after his performance on Sunday night during the North London derby against Arsenal which Spurs won 2-0.Delle Ali and Harry Kane netted as Spurs ensured they will finish above their North London rivals for the first time in 22 years, but it was Wanyama's performance in midfield alongside Eric Dier that drew attention.The imposing Kenyan midfielder has been instrumental in the Lilywhites campaign this season, has played in 32 of the 34 Premier League games so far, scoring twice. He could have had a third on Sunday, but he was denied by a superb Peter Cech save.Wanyama received a man of the match commendation from the Daily mail who graded him 8.5 out of 10 while the White Hart Lane faithful praised the 25-year-old's efforts on the pitch and how much of a role he had played in the victory by not allowing the Arsenal players any time on the ball."At &pound;9million has there been a better signing this season? An absolute monster." Daily Mail's Sammy Mokbel said of the midfielder's performance.Here are some of the best reactions of Wanyama's performance on Twitter:Glenn ShelfSideYid @glenn_spursWanyama had a good game today.
