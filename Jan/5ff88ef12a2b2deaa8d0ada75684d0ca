Luanda &mdash; One of the challenges in the waters sector has to do with the population growth index, due to the appearance of new urbanisation trends and new infrastructures, which have had a great influence in the distribution of the precious liquid.This was said last Tuesday, in Luanda, by the director of the water company of Jerusalem (Israel), Zohar Yinon, who was delivering a lecture at a workshop on "Water Technology and Environmental Control", promoted by the Israeli Embassy in Angola, in partnership with the Public Water Company of Luanda (EPAL).Zohar Yinon said that lately there is a tendency for the population to abandon the villages and settle in the cities, and this is a great challenge for the water supply sector.The workshop was organised with the goal to promote the International Water Exposition, which will happen on 12-14 September, this year, in Israel."The presence of Angola in that event will be beneficial, since we are going to tackle issues that challenge the world. Water shortage is a matter for everyone, so we intend to share solutions (...)", he explained.
