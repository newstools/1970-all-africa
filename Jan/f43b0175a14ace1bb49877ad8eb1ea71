Two individuals have already completed a course in agriculture with another six people departing for Japan in the coming two weeks to attend courses in Transportation, Health and Social Security.At this week's reception, Ambassador Sakamoto commended the trainees for their diligent participation in the respective courses encouraging them to help improve the civil service by utilising the specialised knowledge and upgraded skills they have acquired.A special testimony regarding the value of the training in Japan came from the Diamond Commissioner in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Mr Kennedy Hamutenya, who attended a training course in Japan in 1996.Talking on behalf of the group, he told the guests that the training he received in Japan was very useful to help him fulfil his duties.
