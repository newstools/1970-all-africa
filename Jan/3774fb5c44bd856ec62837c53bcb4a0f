Supporters are joining forces to ensure that the 2017 Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) goes on as planned after it didn't take place in 2016.Friends of the festival immediately moved to start a crowd-funding campaign to keep the event afloat using #HIFAmusthappen. Challenges have made it more and more difficult for funders to continue donating the way they normally have in the past.Tafadzwa Simba, executive associate director of HIFA, said in a statement, "We are so grateful to the community of art lovers from all over the world who have come together to support the campaign. Every contribution helps towards ensuring the future of HIFA."The 17-year-old arts festival showcases the best local, regional and international arts and culture and works to share the best of Zimbabwean spirit.
