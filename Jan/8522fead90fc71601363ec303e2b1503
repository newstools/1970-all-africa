Arusha &mdash; The government has reassured tourism operators that new levies and other charges will not be introduced without consultation. The minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Prof Jumanne Maghembe, said rumours going around in the country that the government planned to impose new fees as of July 1 were untrue.Prof Maghembe was speaking during the opening of Karibu Fair in Arusha on Friday."The government wants to make the industry competitive," he said.Earlier, Tanzania Association of Tour Operators (Tato) chairman Wilbard Chambulo implored the minister to consult the private before introducing new fees, levies and other charges."Please, give a 12-month notice and involve the private sector before introducing new fees, levies and other charges to create trust in the international tourism market and remain competitive globally," Mr Chambulo insisted.According to former Tato vice chairman Zuher Fazal, Karibu Fair is the second largest tourism show in Africa after South Africa's Indaba and joint efforts between private and public sectors are needed to make it an international exhibition."We need to elevate the fair from local to an international travel and a tourism show, but this can only be possible through public-private-partnership to market it extensively," Mr Fazal explained.Part of the 18-year-old outdoor event's uniqueness and excitement is that it offers real safari experience. Karibu Fair chairman Sam Diah said the three-day event, which is registered with the UN World Tourism Organisation, attracted nearly 8,000 local, regional and international visitors.The event, which is well covered by local, regional, and international media, attracts thousands of people.It gives participants an opportunity to exchange ideas, build alliances and network locally, regionally and internationally.
