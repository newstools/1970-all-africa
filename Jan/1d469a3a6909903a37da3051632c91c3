Just days after the burial of flashy Ugandan businessman Ivan Ssemwanga, his former wife Zari Hassan has spoken about the family dispute over his property.In an interview with millardayo.com the Ugandan socialite said Ssemwanga&rsquo;s property in Uganda has a loan to be repaid after which it will be determined way forward.She further explained that the college is South Africa is safe under her management as she is a director there and understands the business as they started it with her ex-husband.Zari steered clear of who will be the heir of the property adding that the important thing is that her children get to be provided for their basic needs such as food, education, home and medical bills.Asked about her reaction to the statement made by Ssemwanga&rsquo;s uncle Herbert Luyinda that she was not entitled to inheriting any property she said:&ldquo;I was just calm because there is paper work and not even someone&rsquo;s uncle can just wake up and say he wants this. On top of that you have to know that since this guy is gone but he has kids they are next in line of his legacy and as a grown-up he can always look for his own legacy. I think after realizing that he apologized,&rdquo; said Zari.NO BEEFThe socialite said she can never abandon her ex-husband&rsquo;s family as their children need the extended family and she will need all the help she can get as raising boys is not easy.&ldquo;People are saying there is beef between us but there is no beef between me and that family. Whether I like them or not they are my kids&rsquo; family, I would never fight them. I need them in the future. The kids will grow and maybe sometimes I will fail I need to call them and tell them right now we are broke I need someone to pay school fees or one of the boys is getting married where are the uncles and grandfathers. I would never fight them she added.I' m looking at an aspect where I need them in future and much as they have a step dad they a bigger father figure who can authoritatively correct them when they are wrong,&rdquo; she said.Zari revealed how she urged her husband Diamond Platinumz to let her settle the disputes with her in-laws adding that much as he wanted to be there a lot was going on.The mother of five said all she is focusing on is running the South African colleges as well as two other houses and the hotel in Uganda.In her tell-it-all interview she revealed that the other child whom people have been saying is Ssemwanga&rsquo;s is his late brother&rsquo;s daughter whom they adopted after her father was shot dead in a robbery incident at Ssemwanga&rsquo;s home.
