I shed tears every day, and I still finding it difficult to accept his death," he added.Commenting on the artist's upcoming birthday on April 24, Lewiz said he plans on spending it with Quincy B's mother, his daughter and her mother.The case against Lewiz, which lasted about two weeks, came to an end when Traffic Court Judge Jomah Jallah dropped the charges against him on Monday, and ordered the Writ of Arrest of the case dismissed.
