Abuja &mdash; Ontario Oil and Gas Limited, which is one of the three oil marketing firms reportedly owing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) financial refunds for under-delivery of products in the defunct crude for product swap regime has offered to repay the corporation what it owes it with its petroleum products tank farm in Oghara, Delta State.But the corporation might have rejected the offer on the basis that the actual value of the tank farm in Oghara would not be enough to repay the total amount owed the NNPC by the company.THISDAY yesterday gathered from a top placed source in the NNPC that so far, Ontario has not made any concrete commitment to settle the outstanding obligation to the corporation. The source explained that the tank farm offer was perhaps the most tangible option Ontario had but that NNPC's rejection has left it with no commitment yet."Ontario doesn't have money now, they said if we could take their tank farm in Oghara but when we valued it, it was under what they are owing and they have not showed any sign of repayment, only Aiteo and Televeras have done that," said the NNPC source.The disclosure by the source also coincided with a statement from the Group General Manager, Public Affairs of the NNPC, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, which explained that so far, two of the companies involved in the reconciliation exercise namely Aiteo Energy Resources and Televeras Group of Companies have registered their commitment to settle all outstanding obligations.NNPC stated in the statement that already Televeras has agreed to make a tranche payment of $17.2 million, but unlike Aiteo and Televaras which have made firm commitment to the recovery process, it was yet to obtain any such commitment from Ontario.The corporation noted that nonetheless, negotiation on the repayment with Ontario would progress, and that it would achieve full recovery of the outstanding $184 million crude-swap-product under-deliveries as well as the full value of stock of its missing petrol in Capital Oil depot which it said was 82 million litres amounting to over N11 billion.NNPC also said it would provide regular information on its ongoing efforts to sanitise its record books through the painstaking reconciliation of the transactions executed during the defunct swap regime.The statement also disclosed that in line with the ongoing reforms in the industry, the corporation was committed to ensuring transparency and adequate public information on the ongoing recovery effort.
