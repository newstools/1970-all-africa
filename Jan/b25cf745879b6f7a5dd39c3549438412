The keyboardist parted ways with the group when Lucky was at his peak, forming the Slaves, who released a few albums in the early 90s before changing their name to the One People Band.Following Dube's tragic death in 2007, Cele and co were left flying the flag for local roots reggae (although struggling to fill Dube's giant shoes), along with the current incarnation of the Lucky Dube Band.The "One People" band rose from the ashes of pain caused by the tragic passing of their talented and charismatic leader, Lucky Dube in October 2007.Stepping up to the microphone is the amiable and equally charming Thuthukani Cele, and "Thuthu" as he is known to his fans is doing a remarkable job bringing Lucky Dube's prophetic words to local audiences who have suddenly developed an insatiable appetite for the tunes, devouring each word and nuance.The band has now performed in numerous major festivals in South Africa receiving standing ovations with each performance.
