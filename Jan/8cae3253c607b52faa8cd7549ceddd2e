According to Kebonang, the confidentially and negotiation surrounding large government mining contracts is fine. "We have various representatives from the Ministry, parastatal and private sectors Government and private attorneys and mining experts who are part of government's negotiating team.The participation of such parties in the negotiation process renders the negotiation process transparent," he was quoted as saying.
