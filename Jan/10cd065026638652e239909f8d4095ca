On 4 May 2017, at the World Economic Forum on Africa in Durban South Africa, the African Development Bank's Vice-President Power for Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Amadou Hott and the UN Environment Regional Director, Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, launched one the most important publications in the energy sector, the 'Atlas of Africa Energy Resources.' In the presence of representatives of the private sector, key African institutions and Civil Society organizations, Hott highlighted the importance and benefits the publication of the Atlas represent. "We have no doubt that this Atlas will be instrumental in facilitating ease of access to information and data in the energy sector for all stakeholders, including the donor community, African Governments and the private sector," he said.He added that development institutions will benefit from the Atlas. "At the African Development Bank, we are convinced that this Atlas will assist us in implementing our ambitious programme under the New Deal on Energy for Africa, whose main objective is to achieve universal energy access in Africa by 2025, Hott said, adding that this would entail providing electricity access to over 200 million households and clean cooking access to around 150 million households.The Atlas of Africa Energy Resources was produced by the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) in partnership with the UN Environment and the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA). The ICA and SEFA are both hosted by the African Development Bank. A G8 initiative, the main objective of the ICA is to increase investments for infrastructure development in Africa, from both public and private sources. SEFA provides resources for renewable energy project preparation and equity investments, as well as technical assistance to African institutions in improving the enabling environment for private investments.The Atlas of Africa Energy Resources features over 64 maps and 73 satellite images as well as some 50 graphics and hundreds of compelling photos. The Atlas makes a major contribution to knowledge on Africa's energy sector by highlighting the opportunities and challenges for sustainable development of the energy resources on the continent.The Atlas, including individual satellite images and other graphics can be downloaded from the website of the ICA and from UN Environment.
