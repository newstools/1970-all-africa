Last week we discussed the crotchet hair pieces and the feedback I got was that while it is quicker to fix, it can be quite costly compared to everyday braids, something I may have forgotten to mention.Continuing on the crotchet path, the trend is now moving from your hair to the wardrobe. The hand-crotchet outfits are standout pieces for the Boho-chic look.The look screams free spirit, exotic, hippy and artistic. Nothing says artistic like a hand-made piece. From tops, colourful embroidered dresses to midi-skirts, the trend has been spreading like wildfire.The fire was fanned when model Kendall Jenner wore one with a see-through vibe to last year's Coachella festival. In Uganda, model Nina Mirembe is at the forefront of promoting the trend under her Nina Mire label.She kicked off with her vibrant swimwear, then to tops, and the sky is the limit on how far she will go, given she is using online platforms to sell the products worldwide.Crotchet tops can be paired with high-waist skirts. Do not forget aviator shades if it is a sunny day.Leather sandals, also known as craft shoes, have become a staple for the look. Time to take your hippy side to the next level.
