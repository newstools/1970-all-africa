Kaiseraugst, Switzerland &mdash; Breakthrough for animal nutrition to reduce impact on ocean resources and making it more sustainableCommercial-scale facility for algal oil for salmon aquaculture and pet food to be built in the United StatesFurther develop and produce a high value algal oil with a natural balance of EPA and DHARoyal DSM and Evonik today announced their intention to establish a joint venture for omega-3 fatty acid products from natural marine algae for animal nutrition. This breakthrough innovation will, for the first time, enable the production of omega-3 fatty acids for animal nutrition without using fish oil from wild caught fish, a finite resource. Evonik and DSM's alternative omega-3 source is the first to offer both EPA and DHA and will be aimed at initial applications in salmon aquaculture and pet food. The companies will together build a commercial-scale production facility in the United States.DSM Nutritional Products and Evonik Nutrition &amp; Care will each hold a 50% share in the joint venture and co-own the production facility, which will be built at an existing site of Evonik and is expected to come on stream in 2019. The joint venture plans to invest around US$ 200 million in the facility (USD 100 million by each party over circa 2 years). The initial annual production capacity will meet roughly 15% of the total current annual demand for EPA and DHA by the salmon aquaculture industry. The set-up of the joint venture, to be named Veramaris and headquartered in The Netherlands, will be finalized subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.Evonik's and DSM's highly concentrated algal oil is a high value and pure source that will enable the animal nutrition industry to keep up with the increasing demand for these two essential omega-3 fatty acids without endangering fish stocks, contributing to healthy animal nutrition as well as to the ecological balance and biodiversity of the oceans.The text of the full press release can be found at http://www.dsm.com and http://www.evonik.comFor more information:DSM Nutritional ProductsHerman Bettentel. +31(0)45-5782017e-mail herman.betten@dsm.comEvonik IndustriesMatthias Ruchtel.: +49(0)201-177-3348e-mail: matthias.ruch@evonik.comVideo:http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/475939/DSM_and_Evonik.pdf
