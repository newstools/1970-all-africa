Johannesburg &mdash; SOUTH African Airways and Hawaiian Air lines have established a new interline agreement providing new and convenient flight options between the two destinations. The new interline partnership enables SAA and Hawaiian Airlines to broaden their route networks to provide some of the fastest connections between Hawaii and destinations throughout Africa. "Our mutual customers will enjoy the warm traditional South African and Hawaiian Island hospitality throughout their journey from two award-winning airlines," said Aaron Munetsi, SAA Acting General Manager Commercial. With immediate effect, customers will be able to purchase a single itinerary for travel on flights of both carriers in one simple transaction and enjoy convenient connections via New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport between Hawaiian Airlines' neighbour island network in Hawaii and over 75 destinations in Africa served by SAA. This new partnership will offer increased convenience to customers by allowing travel on one single electronic ticket and through interline baggage transfer upon check-in with either SAA or Hawaiian Airlines in the U.S. or Southern Africa. Hawaiian, the premier global carrier for leisure travel to Hawai'i, operates A330 aircraft featuring fully-flat bed seats on its nonstop flights between JFK and Honolulu International Airport. Amenities include personal on-demand entertainment system, comfortable legroom and a roomy interior coupled with island-inspired complimentary meals and made-in-Hawai'i snacks.
