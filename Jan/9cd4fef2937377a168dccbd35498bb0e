In this case, the idea that the global community particularly the Security Council must support the efforts of Inter Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD).One of the other good results is that the council has accepted the settlement of a Rapid Deployment Force by IGAD.Speaking of establishing sustainable peace and stable government in Somalia, Meles said Ethiopia has won the council's acceptance in terms of its actions against terrorism and peace keeping tasks. The council has also accepted the ideas that Somalia needs humanitarian support and strong security force as well.Briefing on other international issues like the conflict in Syria, he said Ethiopia believes that state institutions should not be destroyed for beneficiaries of such action are terrorist groups and fundamentalists. Therefore, including the council's member countries which are standing behind the conflicting groups and other nations should participate in the activities of negotiations to maintain sustainable peace.Ethiopia has repeatedly presented its idea in different conferences that the victims and vulnerable society members of the conflict areas must gain appropriate humanitarian support, he noted.
