They announced the elections three weeks ago yet they had not made transport arrangements. They were looking for transport this morning," Mr Muchiri said.Hundreds of ballot papers marked in favour of a parliamentary aspirant and a sitting MCA also fuelled allegations that the polls were already rigged.Kirimari ward aspirant Morris Collo said he was shocked to find that his new name was missing from the ballot despite him having communicated the same with the IEBC.Reporting by By Joseph Openda, Uzzler Ochieng, Francis Mureithi, Magdalene Wanja, Reitz Mureithi and Eric Matara, Charles Wanyoro
