The terms are very friendly making it a convenient source for our infrastructure funding," Mr Rotich said.The loan has a repayment period of 30 years and will attract a 1.2 per cent interest rate.Ngong Road dualling had also received about Sh1.4 billion from Japan for its ongoing first phase from the national Library to the Ring Road Kilimani junction.Construction of the 3.4 kilometre stretch, which is the second phase, is expected to start next year.
