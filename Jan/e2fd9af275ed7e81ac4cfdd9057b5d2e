One of the key issues on the agenda of the African Union summit starting in Addis Ababa today is using the continent's population growth. Many fear the rise in the continent's population, but reject any quotas on birth rates. "The goal is to have a strong, responsible and active working population," according to Population Minister Kaffa R&eacute;kiatou Christian Jackou for Niger, the country with the highest population growth rate, where a woman gives birth to an average of 7.6 children. Another is tackling security threats and other ongoing crises - particularly in the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa - against the background of funding cuts from international partners such as the European Union and United States.
