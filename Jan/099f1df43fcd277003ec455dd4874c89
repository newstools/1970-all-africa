My mother was never one. I don't pray to be one either. Not even any of our daughters. I pray we all grow up together."So our kids will learn, watch and know what being a father and a husband is like; what being a mother and a wife looks like when we must have given birth to them."They will understand what genuine parental love, a home and a family look like."I want us to be their definition of life forever.
