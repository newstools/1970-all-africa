With the increase in China's power and the implementation of the "going-out" strategy, China's policy towards Africa became the focus of the international community, while for China; South-South cooperation became more significant.The Gambia like many of its African allies have benefitted from the Chinese medical expertise until 1995, following the 1994 revolution.Impact of Chinese Medical Cooperation in AfricaChina-Africa cooperation has contributed a great deal to the service of African patients, improvement of the public health systems and raising the standard of local medical services.Resumption of Diplomatic TiesThe Islamic Republic of The Gambia resumed diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 2016 following former President Yahya Jammeh's announcement of the end to his country's 18-year relationship with Taiwan which shocked not only Taiwanese officials, but local experts who were aghast and left striving to decipher the sudden move by the former president.On the side of the media, the Chinese top diplomat told journalists that he was also thinking of coming up with a media exchange programme between the two countries.
