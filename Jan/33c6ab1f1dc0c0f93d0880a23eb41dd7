Buravan's performance put the audience in the mood of excitement.But then things moved a notch higher when rapper Emery Gatsinzi, commonly known as Riderman got on stage and the atmosphere became electric.The Primus Guma Guma Super Star Season 3 winner got on stage to a raucous welcome by his fans known as Ibisumizi but he failed to connect with the band, which forced him to rely on DJ's as he performed Abanyabirori and Cugusa.He however managed to perform Horo live and a few more songs before he called it a day. Nevertheless he proved that he is still a force to reckon with on the local music scene.DJ Infinity and Dutch DJ Pim ensured that the audience was entertained with impressive mixes on the decks.
