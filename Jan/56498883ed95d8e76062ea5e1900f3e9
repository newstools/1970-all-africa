New York &mdash; The silver screen debut of the superhero has prompted a host of celebratory initiativesWith "Wonder Woman" blazing a trail at theaters across the United States, the female superhero is being hailed as a powerful new role model for girls and a break away from sexism in Hollywood.The film, starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, smashed box office records on its opening weekend, raking in more than $103 million in the United States - a record for a movie directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins. The film broke the previous record for a movie directed by a woman held by Sam Taylor-Johnson for "Fifty Shades of Grey".Online debates ahead of the film's release about the Amazonian superhero's lack of armpit hair and the furor surrounding her selection last year as a U.N. honorary ambassador, have only served to boost box office takings.But it is above all the depiction of the sword-wielding, lasso-tossing character as an empowered woman that accounts for the film's triumph, said Melissa Silverstein, founder of the Women and Hollywood blog and co-founder of the women-focused Athena Film Festival."It's almost an exclamation point on what women have been saying for a long time - in the industry, outside the industry; that our stories matter, we are the heroes of the stories, we can kick butt as well as anyone else and we're equal," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.Wonder Woman was first imagined in 1941 as an icon of female empowerment - even appearing on the inaugural cover of the flagship feminist publication Ms. magazine three decades later.But her modern portrayal has been criticized for shifting to a sexualized buxom character, typically clad in a red, white and blue body suit.The United Nations dumped Wonder Woman less than two months after naming her as an ambassador for women's and girls' empowerment amid criticism that her pin-up image sent the wrong message.The film reverts to her original incarnation."Wonder Woman" is one of three comic-book superheroes from the 1930s and 1940s whose stories have been published almost without interruption - alongside Batman and Superman - according to Harvard history professor Jill Lepore.Yet, Jenkins' film is the first theatrical release starring the Princess of the Amazons.Her debut on the silver screen has prompted a host of celebratory initiatives.In New York, "Wonder Woman" enthusiasts have raised more than $8,000 in six days to send high-school girls to a screening in Washington D.C.And female-only showings by the cinema chain Alamo Drafthouse have sold out from Austin, Texas, to New York, with promises of proceeds going to Planned Parenthood, a women's healthcare provider.We're proud to be hosting #WonderWoman screenings for women ONLY (incl our staff) w/ all proceeds going to @PPFA! : https://t.co/ILueTsJH6R pic.twitter.com/LmmgAnmBcg- Alamo Drafthouse NYC (@AlamoNYC) May 25, 2017Silverstein said the blockbuster should herald a new era in a Hollywood film industry skewed in favor of male characters and filmmakers.Last year, females comprised just 29 percent of protagonists among the 100 top-grossing U.S. films, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, California.Behind the scenes, women made up just 7 percent of directors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2016, a study by the same centre shows."The bigger picture is, for me, that women stories are as valid as male stories," said Silverstein.- Reporting by Sebastien Malo, Editing by Emma Batha
