Samburu county government has given Westgate Conservancy Sh6 million to curb human-wildlife conflict in the area.The conservancy is under Samburu National Reserve in Samburu East, Archers Post.The fund will also support employment of more wildlife scouts to help in the fight against poaching.According to Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkul, due to the ongoing drought, a number of wildlife has been killed from October last year by poachers as the animals found their way outside the conservancies in search of water and pasture.Speaking to Nation.co.ke during the event, Mr Lenolkulal said the county has heightened conservation activities to save the already endangered wildlife.In the recent past, there has been an increased number of cases where wild animals have invaded people's homes in various parts of the county in search of food and water.Several community owned conservancies have also been put in place to help create awareness in wildlife protection and in fighting against poaching.
