SDG 3 also matches African Union's Agenda 2063 'The Africa We Want', which targets healthy lives for all Africans."Rwanda set up innovative solutions such as Ubudehe, a home-grown system that assigns health support to our people according to their socio-economic status. Our country is now advancing towards Universal Health Coverage for its people," Premier Murekezi said.He recalled that Rwanda achieved the Health Millennium Development Goals and gained recognition on a global scale for the multiple achievements.The two-day forum brings together senior government officials, Finance and Health Ministers, representatives from UN Agencies, academicians, civil society players, philanthropic foundations, private sector and the youth.
