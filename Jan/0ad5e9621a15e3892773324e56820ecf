Political leadership and traditional rulers in Sokoto State have resolved to step up surveillance for possible disease outbreak and breach of security across the state.This followed the outcome of an emergency meeting between Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and traditional rulers led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa'ad Abubakar which held in Sokoto.Others in attendance were the state Deputy Governor, Ahmed Aliyu, commissioners, local government chairmen and all district and village heads under the Sultanate Council.Speaking at the event, Tambuwal said it had become imperative to increase surveillance especially at the grassroots level."Our recent experience with meningitis and severe strain of malaria experienced last year indicates that with more surveillance, many of the diseases would have been traced earlier, and the casualty level would have been much lower," the governor added.On security, Tambuwal directed local government chairmen to reintroduce the monthly security meeting, and ensure prompt attendance by all stakeholders at that level.He also directed all District Heads to write reports about the situation of their localities every two weeks and submit same to the Sultanate Council for necessary action.He also urged them to monitor movements of persons in their domains, and should take the lead in mobilising the populace on policies and programme of the government particularly in areas of health, education, agriculture among others.Tambuwal also appealed to District Heads to desist from granting mineral rights to illegal miners in their areas.In his remarks, Sultan Abubakar commended the state government for convening the meeting which he said was essential in fostering cordial working relationship among all segments of the society.He said religious and traditional rulers are always on hand to render services to the government when called upon to do so.The Sultan commended governor Tambuwal for executing various developmental projects in the state.
