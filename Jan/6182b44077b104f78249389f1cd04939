Lagos &mdash; FirstNation Airways which operations were downgraded from scheduled to charter services by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) on Monday, vowed yesterday that it will return to scheduled services by the fourth quarter of 2017.The airline explained that it is currently pursuing a fleet expansion programme that would increase the number of its aircraft.It operated with one aircraft for nine months following a waiver granted it by the NCAA as the civil aviation regulations provide a minimum of two aircraft for an airline to operate scheduled services. NCAA, however wielded the big stick on Monday by downgrading the airline's operations to charter services until its fleet improved.The airline, in a statement by its Corporate Affairs Manager, Rasheed Yusuf, however insisted that its Airworthiness status, Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A), had not been downgraded. It said it renewed its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) for charter services.The statement read: "Our airworthiness status was never downgraded as wrongly reported. There is a clear distinction between certificate of airworthiness (c of a) and air operator's certificate (AOC)," it said.
