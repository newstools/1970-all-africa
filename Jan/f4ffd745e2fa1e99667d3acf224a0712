Lafia &mdash; A lecturer at the Department of Geology and Mining of the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Professor Shedrach Jatau, has warned people against poisoning water, especially rivers for fishing purposes.Jatau who spoke while presenting a paper in Lafia at the Celebration of 2017 World Water Day organised by the Nigerian Water Supply Association (NWSA), said the call was necessitated by the activities of some local fishermen in the habit of poisoning an entire source of water to catch fish.He described the practice as a serious threat to human, fish and other animals found in the water, adding, "The same people poisoning the water still go home and eat the fish from the poisoned water or sell them to other people in the society without thought for the health implication of their actions."
