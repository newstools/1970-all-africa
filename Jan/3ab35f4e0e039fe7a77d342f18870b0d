Nyeri &mdash; A family in Mwihoko village in Nyeri County is appealing to the National Government and nurses to come up with a speedy solution and end the strike that has affected medical services in the country.Catherine Mungai says she was sent home from Nyeri County Referral Hospital immediately the medics went on strike and now seeks medical attention in private hospitals at a higher fee.Catherine cries that the cost to cater for her weekly "clinic" is high saying she is forced to pay Sh6,000 every week.The 50-year-old says that she is anaemic and has suffered from fibroids for the past two years, a condition she says has kept her out of work and in need of special diet yet she can barely put food on the table.The mother of four says that the cost of treatment at a private facility has now put the education of her children in jeopardy.The husband Paul Mungai reports that they have had to sell off four cows, a motorcycle and other belongings to facilitate her treatment in private facilities. "These are impossible choices."The family is now calling on the nurses to go back to work as many families are suffering, taking the view that health should not have been devolved.
