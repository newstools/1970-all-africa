He then urged them to remain committed while also making the most judicious use of the nation's resources entrusted in their care. He equally seized the opportunity to commend the NAF medical personnel that had been participating in NAF humanitarian interventions in various IDP camps in the North East. He expressed delight at the outcomes of the medical outreach programmes, which have proved to be an opportunity "to give hope to the hopeless", he said.At Yola, Air Marshal Abubakar commended the efforts of the personnel in the ongoing fight against insurgency. He added that the nation was proud of them and that the NAF would continue to do its best at ensuring their welfare. He then informed the personnel that the NAF had just completed the reactivation of one Do-228 aircraft, which would be used to reintroduce courier service in the NAF. In addition, the CAS revealed that the second NAF ATR-42 aircraft had been reactivated and would be used to regularly airlift the frontline troops to visit their families.It is recalled that the Air Marshal has consistently feted with NAF frontline troops during all festive occasions since his assumption of duty as the CAS, a development which has continued to raise the morale of the personnel.
