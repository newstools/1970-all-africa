Cape Town &mdash; SHELL, the multinational oil and gas company, has been confirmed as a platinum sponsor for the African Utility Week set for Cape Town next month. Tendani Ndwamise, Lubes Direct Sector B2B Marketer at Shell South Africa, expressed delight at the company returning to the event for a third time. In addition to hosting a booth with experts from global and local business, Dr Peter Smith, with over 30 years' experience in the development of lubricants for use in the sector, will be as a speaker for the event. "African Utility Week is a high priority event for Shell," said Ndwamise. "It gives us the opportunity to not only connect with manufacturers and utilities in South Africa, but also the wider African continent and also internationally. We are delighted that a number of our customers outside of Africa have also chosen to attend the event." Shell has launched two new ranges of products for the power sector - Shell Diala S4 for use in transformers and Shell Turbo S4, our premium turbine oil range. In South Africa, we have been working closely with Eskom to conduct field trials for Shell Diala S4. On the rest of the continent, Shell has supplied a number of projects with both ranges, notably the Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project and the Mega project in Egypt. Set for May 16-18, the 17th annual African Utility Week will gather over 7 000 decision makers from more than 80 countries to source the latest solutions and meet over 300 suppliers. Along with multiple side events and numerous networking functions the event also boasts a five track conference with over 300 expert speakers. - CAJ News
