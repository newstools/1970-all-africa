They have been present at MINUSTAH since 2010...you have been dynamic as prominent players in all facets of Haiti Nation Police development."He emphasised that "Rwanda is a very important partner of the United Nations in the context of peacekeeping" which he added that this fact is defined by the presence of over 6000 Rwandan peacekeepers in all missions currently, who also include military and prisons.MINUSTAH has 178 Rwandan police officers, including 160 under Formed Police Unit (FPU)."I would like to remind you, that like your predecessors, you have distinguished yourself by your significant participation in the implementation of the development plan of Haiti National Police. Thus, through your continued commitment, you have contributed to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment, conducive to the revival of the country," said Gen Monchotte.Speaking on behalf of the decorated officers, Supt. Eric Murenzi expressed Rwanda's commitment towards contributing to peace building, and the values that define each and every Rwandan peacekeeper, which guides them to success.He thanked the MINUSTAH leadership for the support throughout their one year mission mandate, which he said helped them to execute their peacekeeping duties effectively and maintained the UN standards.
