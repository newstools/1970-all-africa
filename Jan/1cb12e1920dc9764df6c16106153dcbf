Santa Clara, California &mdash; Offering a wider array of technologies and catering to varied wastewater utility needs will grow business opportunities, finds Frost &amp; Sullivan's Environment &amp; Water teamUrban and suburban sprawl, incremental population growth, warmer metropolitan areas, and complaints about public odor are driving growth in the North American municipal wastewater treatment odor control market. Growth is augmented by the need for corrosion control in wastepipes and the health and safety of municipal employees. In order to remain competitive in a consolidated market, players must seek out partnerships, merger and acquisition opportunities, or develop more attractive premium solutions that simplify contracts and take away shares from regional, low-margin suppliers."Participants in the wastewater odor treatment market should focus on a core technology and develop further services to add value to their solution, or like Evogua Water Technologies, the market leader, develop a wider portfolio of technologies and solutions that allows it to expand its footprint and cater to varied utility needs," said Frost &amp; Sullivan Energy &amp; Environment Industry Analyst Seth Cutler.North American Municipal Wastewater Treatment Odor Control Market, the latest analysis from Frost &amp; Sullivan's Environment &amp; Water Growth Partnership Service program, finds that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5 percent from 2016 to 2021 with expected revenues of $414.3 million in 2021.

Companies involved in parallel verticals could also package together larger solutions and deliver economies of scale," noted Cutler.About Frost &amp; SullivanFrost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.
