The workers toil and labour moves the engine of the nations' growth, yet the workers are the victims of government and private sector abuse."He said Nigerian workers have often been abused in the form of denied or delayed wages, delayed gratuity and pensions.According to him, government policies and corruption has led to a questionable privatisation that destroyed our textile mills, sugar and steel factories to mention s few.He said: "While saluting the courage and patience of workers in a cash strap, inflationary economy we demand that government should increase the salary of workers, balance the economy as well as check the growing margin between in income earners."However, it is sad to mention the sad unpatriotic incessant and protracted strike by some sectors of the labour union. Should soldiers and police go on strike what will be made of our society? What moral right then should doctors and even learned lawyers who swore to professional oath embark on strike?""While commemorating and celebrating workers day, we observe with sadness the relationship between the soaring unemployment and the increase in crime and general social vices."The relationship between corruption and unemployment is obvious. We therefore strongly demand that the federal government through its agency should immediately commence the probe of all state government utilisation of the bail out funds.State government should publicly account for how the spend public funds in their trust or be jailed."Kadzai also congratulated the labour sector as the only sector devoid of promoting religious interest.May Day: Excitement as Enugu Workers Honour Ugwuanyi, 'Most Labour-friendly Governor'Workers of Enugu State, yesterday, conferred on Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi the "Most Labour-friendly Governor Award in the history of Enugu State" in recognition of his administration's development strides and commitment to their welfare, despite the severe economic crisis in the country.The state workers, who were visibly joyful, noted that the award was also in appreciation of the governor's sustained harmonious industrial relationship with the state work force, such as regular payment of salaries, pensions and other allowances on or before every 25th of the month, when many other states could not do so.The ceremony, which climax was a match past by all the unions under the various ministries, parastatals, agencies, among others, witnessed for the first time, the pensioners of the state participating in the exercise in a joyful mood.In his welcome address, the state chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Comrade Virginus Nwobodo, commended Gov.
