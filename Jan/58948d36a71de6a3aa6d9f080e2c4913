Asaba &mdash; Workers at the General Hospital, Bomadi, headquarters of Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State are now living in great fear following series of attack launched against the hospital by men of the underworld.Reports said the frequency and relative ease with which the bandits invade the hospital has reached freighting dimension.Eyewitness accounts claimed that the hoodlums made their nocturnal attacks on the Bomadi hospital four times last week alone, carting away valuables and cash belonging to both workers and patients on admission.THISDAY learnt that the hoodlums severally broke into the doctor's house, making away with foodstuff including, quite recently, a bag of rice belonging to an NYSC member.A generator belonging to a nurse was also reportedly taken away by the hoodlums who ransacked her apartment while subjecting patients to horrifying experience by removing their personal effects, including bags, cash and telephones.A reliable source stressed that fear had gripped the entire hospital workforce especially those on night duty as security in the hospital, which is located far from the town centre, was anything but tight."These boys come into the hospital at night when the patients are sleeping, they move from room to room of workers living inside the hospital armed with cutlass and other dangerous weapons. They enter the hospital wards and remove patients valuables and money."From last Friday to this last weekend, they attacked the hospital four times. They used to come before now but the frequency nowadays has put much fear in the people working here. We need protection from the police and the community", a worker said on condition of anonymity.When contacted, the state Police Public Relation Officers, Mr. Andrew Chiamaka, quoted the divisional police officers in the area as denying that the hospital was "under siege of robbers"as was being rumoured.
