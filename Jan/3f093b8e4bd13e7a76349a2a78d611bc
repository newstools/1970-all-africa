"It's also an indication of how much opportunity exists, to tap more Rwandans into formal banking. We intend to deploy new strategies to acquire more customers to grow our base,"As opposed to opening new branches, the bank chose to expand its agency network, which stood at 1,321 during the first quarter of the year.The agents, who help take the bank's services to where it has no branch presence, processed over 306,800 transactions worth Rwf15.9 billion.BK boasts 79 branches, 93 ATMs and 1,038 point of sale terminals that accept most international cards, including VISA and MasterCard.The expansive network helped the bank mobilise clients' balances and deposits which increased to Rwf95.0 billion during the period under review, an 8.4 per cent increase year-on-year.In March, the bank unveiled two new subsidiaries; BK General Insurance and BK TecHouse, with the latter expected to help the bank stay ahead of technology by being the engine of innovation.Recently, the bank opened a modern digital service centre at Kigali Heights, a paperless branch aimed at giving the bank's customers a sneak peek into the future.
