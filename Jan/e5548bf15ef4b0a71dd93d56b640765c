As the Presidential and Representatives elections approach, the security sector continues to boost its readiness in order to see the process successful.Looking at the crucial role of the military, the Chief of Defense Staff of the Arm Forces of Liberia, Major General G. Daniel Dee Ziankahn Jr., has sent a strong message to the army not to be seen partaking in political related matters as that is not part of their mandate.He said that despite the interest of politics in every human being, the Army exists mainly to maintain the peace and security of the country, and their personal interest must not be to the detriment of the security.General Ziankahn said that for the army to be seen credible and neutral, they have a Code of Conduct which frowns at personnel of the AFL being involved in partisan activities.Backing his words, General Ziankahn said that there is a clear mandate limiting whosoever to enter the vicinities of the AFL with political vehicles.Reacting to questions as to whether he would be able to compromise the stance of the army since the Minister of Defense Brownie Samukai has already pledged his support to the Standard Bearer of the Unity Party Joseph Boakai, General Ziankahn said that the Minister has the right to support any candidate of his choice, but when it comes to military matters, there are limitations which he or anyone can not compromise or negotiate.General Ziankahn said that the public has been cooperative during this campaign period as no banner of flyers are seen or pasted on building of the AFL.
