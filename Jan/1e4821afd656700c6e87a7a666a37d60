Bamako &mdash; ARMED groups are openly violating ceasefire agreements by carrying out attacks at checkpoints occupied by the Malian Armed Forces, killing at least 11 officers in the defiance. The violations have been prevalent in Timbuktu, in the north of the country. The armed groups are opposed to the installation of the Taoudenit interim authorities, which was originally scheduled for Monday, and represents a crucial step in the implementation of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mali. Two checkpoints have been attacked this week. The United Nations Integrated Multifaceted Mission for the Stabilization of Mali (MINUSMA) denounced the violations. "MINUSMA strongly condemns these actions, which represent violations of the ceasefire and expose their perpetrators to sanctions," said a MINUSCA spokesperson. Talks were said to be progressing to end the violations. MINUSMA demanded an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of armed elements from occupied positions. The UN Security Council established MINUSMA in 2013 to support political processes in the West African country.
