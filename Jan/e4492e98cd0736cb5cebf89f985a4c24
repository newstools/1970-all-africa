President John Magufuli has agreed to send 500 doctors to Kenya as Uhuru Kenyatta's government is suffering shortages as a result of a strike in public hospitals. Kenya's doctors went on strike in December last year over salaries and working conditions. Although a deal opened the way to negotiations to end the strike, many doctors are still not back at work.
