World Music day is celebrated on June 21 every year, yet in Uganda this time round, Alliance Francaise, the organisers of the event, gave the celebrations a twist by making it a week-long festival.This was the second time they were changing the kind of programming after twice placing music on streets, including an orchestra last year. This year, they were looking at spreading the music out and celebrating all genres including spoken word and rap.The celebrations started on Sunday June 18 with poetry meeting music; artistes such as The Body of Brian, Wake and Cyno MC fused music with their poetry/spoken word.Seeing inspirational rapper and poet Wake work crowds with his weave of words was as inspirational as it was breathtaking. An alumnus of Pearl Rhythm's annual Stage Coach, the artiste is yet to get a stage for his solo act, but has been an impressive guest whenever called upon.The second set was at the National theatre on Monday, where Alliance Francaise teamed up with Pearl Rhythm to present a show that had acts including Zoey The Storyteller, Michael Kitanda and Joshua Semwanga alias Joash.Fresh from her lone performance at Nteredde Documentary Showcase last weekend, Zoey had the audience with her stories that mix folktales, songs and folklore instrumentation - some actually think she is doing kadongo kamu or just folk music.Her good friend and usual collaborator, Sandra Kay, a rising artiste from Busoga, backed her performance at the National theatre.Joash, has been called a heartthrob in the making and he indeed did not disappoint especially with the choice of songs that were mostly romantic. His highlight though, was when he channeled his inner Usher Raymond on one of his Luganda ballads done with the piano as the main backing.Wednesday was, however, the most confusing day on the program. It introduced Laurent Assoulen, a pianist and jazz composer and what he called a satire perfume concert.The show was going to present music but mix it all up by appeasing the sense of smell; the arrangement was to let people listen to music while smelling a comparable perfume. For instance, a striking citrus would be followed by a relatively wild sound.Ushers passed out blotters sprayed with different perfumes to accompany the pieces of music he had composed for each scent."I composed each piece of music based on vibration of specific raw materials," explained Assoulen. "I then shared the creation and inspiration with three master perfumers: Anne Flipo, Napoleon Bastos and Carlos Bena&iuml;m, who in turn interpreted and translated these sensations into perfume."It was not an easy concept to sell but people seemed to love it, especially as they waited for perfume blotters to be supplied to them during breaks. Assoulen is an incredible pianist that offered a lot for many to learn especially those that play the instrument; the only problem was that those handling the perfumes somehow mixed the perfumes up.He was supposed to play seven songs, five of which had a corresponding perfume while others were bonus tracks; the ushers gave out all the perfumes before the last perfume song and in some incidents, wrong perfumes were given out for songs they did not match.But it was still a good show; very experimental especially for music that kept on evolving. The closing day was Saturday at the French School (&Eacute;cole Fran&ccedil;aise Les Grands Lacs) along Lugogo bypass with mainly collaborations between James Ssewa and Giovanni Kiyingi, Apio Moro and Haka Mukiga, Jackie Akello and Mame N'Diack, Break Dance Project with Jora MC, and Sylvester and Abramz.The opening acts were the day's hosts, a children's choir from the French school that did a number of renditions including Flo Rida's Good Feeling and Shakira's Waka Waka, among others. They set the stage for Apio and Haka, whose fusion helped people enjoy two different genres and languages.The night closed with a lone performance from Navio, who took the audience through his most loved songs such as Nawulira, Ngalo, Tumunonye and Njogereza.
