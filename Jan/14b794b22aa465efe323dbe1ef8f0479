BAM-NEMSIA Pictures has released the first official trailer of its latest movie, Banana Island Ghost (B.I.G). It comes on the heels of Chigul aka Chioma Omeruah's hilarious prayer for 'Sumtin BIG' that went viral a few weeks ago.Written and directed by BB Sasore, the movie trailer was unveiled at the iMax Cinemas in Lekki, Lagos, to select media practitioners and industry enthusiasts on Wednesday.In the trailer, the cantankerous firecracker, Ijeoma (Chioma Omeruah) wakes up to find a ghost (Patrick Diabuah) next to her. He has three days to fall in love and she will do anything to save her father's house in Banana Island from the bank coming to reclaim it in three days.With three days left to find N18 million, she turns to God for a solution to her problem. Her prayers are answered in the form or Patrick, the ghost! Together, they get into all kinds of hilarious situations but in the process help each other find purpose and fall in love.Patrick died in an accident on Third Mainland Bridge. He believes he cannot go to heaven without a soul mate so he also begs God for a few more days to find one. God, having a sense of humor, pairs him with Ijeoma.
