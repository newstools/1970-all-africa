The United Nations migration agency in Niger says it has saved more than 600 lives since April 2017 through a new search-and-rescue operation that targets migrants stranded in Sahara Desert. The agency said it regretted that 52 migrants, mostly from The Gambia, Nigeria, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire, died over the period.
