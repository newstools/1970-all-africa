The first phase will run from June 26 to 30 and the second round will start from July 17 to 21 July.She however said there is a need for well wishers to help the campaign by providing vehicles that will ferry health workers to the targeted areas as those within the targeted area are not enough for the campaign.Commenting on the Nchalo cholera cases, Mkukumila said it was too early to declare that the outbreak was over as there were still other recent cases registered.The oral cholera vaccination campaign is being supported by the International Vaccine Institute and the World Health Organization.
