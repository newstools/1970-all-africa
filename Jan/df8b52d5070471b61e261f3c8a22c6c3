When he commissioned the maternity ward at Kimaka health center II on April 13, President Museveni urged his audience not to wait to fall sick and then run to hospital."Today, I would like to remind you that what matters in life is not the hospital but the prevention of diseases. If you immunize your children, you prevent diseases; in Uganda we have managed to prevent about 13 diseases and I urge personal hygiene for everyone," Museveni told a gathering at Kimaka health center II in Mpumudde, Jinja on Thursday, April 13.Museveni explained that immunization, eating a balanced diet, good sanitation and living a responsible lifestyle can help control diseases."Spray indoor, feed well, drink clean water, go to hospitals and get vaccinated and with that, you will have achieved 80 per cent prevention against diseases," he said, adding that, "health facilities are for unavoidable health conditions and I, therefore, congratulate Eskom for its contribution [of a maternity ward] to this health center," he said.Speaking at the ceremony, Eskom Uganda Managing Director Thozama Gangi said that the company aims to create a conducive medical facility to supplement government's effort in reducing infant deaths in the country.She said Eskom will continue making a difference in the lives of ordinary people."We at Eskom trust that improved health care will go a long way in improving the infant mortality rate within Jinja municipality," she said."This facility should be a beacon of hope for vulnerable women," she said.Over the last 14 years of operations in Uganda, Eskom has invested in many priority areas, which include health and education, environmental upgrade and sports sponsorship.According Dr Stephen Banonya, the in-charge of Jinja medical health services, Kimaka health center has been giving services like family planning, health education and home visiting services but now with a new facility, people's health is going to improve."From now onwards, the mothers who have been walking for long distances from here to Jinja hospital will be able to access delivering services at this center."Eskom have provided us with all the equipment for delivering that included beds with mattresses, mosquito nets, gloves and oxygen machines and now we can deliver four mothers daily... ," he said.
