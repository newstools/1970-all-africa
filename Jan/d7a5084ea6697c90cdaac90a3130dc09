Senior executives at the audit firm KPMG East Africa are embroiled in boardroom wars that have spilled into the corridors of justice, pitting chief executive Josphat Mwaura against his predecessor Richard Boro Ndung'u.In court documents seen by The EastAfrican, Mr Ndungu has sued the audit firm for expelling him as a partner for protesting how long an investigation into his role in a colleague's domestic dispute had taken."On Monday, October 3, 2016, I was advised by Mr Mwaura and a senior partner that they had commenced investigations touching on me based on an anonymous complaint. I was assured that the said investigations would be expeditious and would not last longer than two days," Mr Ndung'u says in his affidavit.Mr Ndungu claims that KPMG intends to deny him his salary, benefits and bonuses and wants High Court judge Louis Onguto to issue a temporary order preserving his status as a member of KPMG East Africa and a partner in KPMG Kenya.The court documents show that KPMG East Africa members met on January 13 and voted to expel Mr Ndung'u from the audit firm following investigations into the complaint.The letter on the expulsion was handed to Mr Ndung'u on January 19, a day after KPMG issued a staff memo announcing that he would leave the firm in August this year to pursue other interests."The investigations cleared me of any wrongdoing but I am still being pushed out," Mr Ndung'u says.Mr Ndungu says his protest at the duration of the investigation is what led to his expulsion, with the East Africa team accusing him of breaching complaint procedures.Mr Ndung'u served as KMPG East Africa chief executive officer between 2004 and 2008, before rising to be the head of tax. He joined the audit firm in April 1999 as a senior manager before being admitted as a partner in 2000.
