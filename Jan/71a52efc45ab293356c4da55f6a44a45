After its success on the local circuit, Beyond the River is set to hit cinemas outside our borders.According to a statement released by Heartlines, the company behind the inspirational local film, requests have been streaming in as far afield as Belgium, Australia, Argentina, Britain and Tasmania."We have received several messages from international canoe clubs, expats as well as locals who didn't manage to see the film in cinemas. Beyond the River tackles universal themes around trust, understanding and tolerance; we want to make it available to audiences far and wide," says Heartlines CEO and Beyond the River Executive Producer, Dr Garth Japhet.Inspired by the true story of Piers Cruickshanks and Siseko Ntondini, who together competed in one of the toughest river races, the Dusi Canoe Marathon, the widely-acclaimed locally produced film is an adventure drama, which highlights racial tension, inequality and social gaps.South Africans who didn't see the film in cinemas can catch it on DSTV's Box Office from 24 June, and on DVD for rental or retail from mid-July.Source: Channel24 Movies
