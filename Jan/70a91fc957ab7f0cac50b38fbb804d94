As countries engage in diplomatic and security operations, our partnerships could have no threats. That is why we are members of United Nations, African Union and other regional organisations that have the political and legal framework to address regional and security challenges," he said.Many African countries have persistently experienced security problems such as armed groups, conflicts, terrorism and governance as well as crimes such as drugs, human trafficking. All these require appropriate response mechanisms from within Africa itself, he added.Maj Gen Jean Bosco Kazura, the commandant of the college, said the annual symposium helps students to understand the security situation worldwide and take measures when they are back to their country."As Africans, we are thinking of our security by analysing what causes problems in our continent and seek solutions," he said.Gen Kazura added that the symposium is also part of fifth anniversary of the Staff College since its inauguration in 2012, stressing that some lessons will be extracted to inform various researchers and students in their future assignment.Lt Col Like Like, one of the students from Zambia, said the security aspects of every situation have to be understood."We learnt how to manage situations before they escalate because as military we have to provide leadership and direction where it is required," he said.Approach against terrorismNigerian army chief commander, Lt Gen Tukur Yuzuf Buratai, one of the panelists, observed that leadership challenges can cause failure in fighting terrorism."Several factors such as ethnic, political, religious groups are attributed to forming terrorism.
