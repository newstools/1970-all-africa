I got to meet a potential client that I have been trying to contact on my own with no success. The client is a big player in the market in Ghana and has showed huge interest in working with us. We will do follow-ups to make sure that the deal is signed and sealed," said Makamure.Meanwhile, Vaughn Duke of Sound Mining Solutions, said the mission was a success, as it provided the companies an opportunity to meet with their potential partners.The Director of Export Promotions at the dti, Seema Sardha, said she was pleased with the overwhelming response received during the business forum, business-to-business meetings and site visits from both Ghana and Nigeria.She said this demonstrates the enthusiasm from both sides towards building partnerships and value-chains across Africa."We came here with an objective to promote South African products and service offerings, and to create business partnerships between business communities of the respective countries and we have done exactly that," said Sardha.Sardha said companies need to take the necessary steps and follow up on the leads they accrued in making sure they translate them into economic benefits.The programme of the mission included trade and investment seminars, business-to-business meetings and site visits.
