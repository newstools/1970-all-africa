Singapore &mdash; Open source 3D printing designs to revolutionize consumer lifestyleThe evolution of 3D printing from a prototype to a highly advanced manufacturing technology has boosted its uptake in Asia-Pacific. The mounting pressure of mass customization, alongside the need to reduce the time-to-market of products, has prompted 3D printer manufacturers to innovate to new technologies and faster printing speeds."Recognizing the ability of 3D printing to boost productivity and strengthen their manufacturing sectors, governments around the world have launched several initiatives to promote additive manufacturing," said Industrial Process Control Consultant Shreyas Krishnamurthy."This technology is also being actively utilized in the medical industry to build customizable implants and devices," he added.By adding technologically advanced features in 3D printers, the market is heading towards open source 3D printing. This technology could well transform consumer lifestyle by simplifying parts designing, developing product architecture, and even printing artificial organs through modified stem cells.3D Printing and Its Growing Importance in the Asia-Pacific Manufacturing Industry is part of Frost &amp; Sullivan's Industrial Automation &amp; Process Control Growth Partnership Service program.

To overcome these challenges, 3D printer manufacturing companies must aim beyond developing technically advanced equipment and ensure that customers receive overall business value."Asia-Pacific, with an extensive industrial base, supportive government policies, and increased R&amp;D spending, presents companies with significant opportunities for growth in 3D printing," noted Krishnamurthy.Home to nearly 60% of the world's population, having both developed as well as developing nations, including two of the world's fastest growing economies in China and India, the region is well poised to lead the global 3D printing market in the future.About Frost &amp; SullivanFrost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.
