It is in fact a public holiday in the Netherlands, but certainly not a day of rest, as several nationalists flock the city of Amsterdam to celebrate with their king, although traditionally, celebrations start on the eve of his birthday.The theme colour for the event is orange because the King originates from a region called Orange in southeastern France.The kings chose the colour to match with their origin.
