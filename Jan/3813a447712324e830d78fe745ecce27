The entire project is expected to cost about $76 million.On Saturday morning the deputy project manager, Gu Tengfei, together with other CRBC staff toured two prioritized roads including Muhima-Gatsata road (main round about), and Rwandex-Sonatube-Prince House road which will be completed at the end of July 2017.The tour was to evaluate the progress of the ongoing works to avoid any delay which can affect the completion time-lines.Tengfei assured that there is good progress of the ongoing work to upgrade the roads. He also revealed that the main challenges they face include underground equipment for utilities such as water pipes and internet cables that need to be expropriated.At least 3500 people are employed by the firm.Tengfei said that the project will be completed within the agreed timeframe and high on quality.The project has come as a solution to strengthening access roads within the city of Kigali in addition to secondary short-term benefits such as providing jobs to many Rwandans as well encouraging knowledge transfer to the young Rwandan technicians and engineers.In line with emphasizing the issue of knowledge and skills transfer, CRBC signed a memorandum of Understanding with Workforce Development Authority (WDA) promising to offer internship positions to the Rwandan students.Telesphore Bizumuremyi, one of the staff of CRBC assures the company's commitment towards beating the deadline and producing quality work."Though it is still too early, the works are going on well.
