Blessing Kathure and Favour Karimi were born with their spines and lower backs fused. Although each had her own gut, they shared an anus and genitals. At the time of their arrival at Kenyatta National Hospital, one of the girls had a fracture on her right lower limb that was suspected to have been sustained during delivery.
