She now, however, walks on a tightrope as her life hangs in the balance. She requires N10 million to undergo kidney transplant, according to her doctors. Love also suffers from long history of hypertension with periobital and leg swelling.According to a medical report signed by a Consultant Nephrologist at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), Sagamu, Ogun State, Dr. O.O. Oyebisi, "Ologun has a chronic kidney disease in end stage and has been on twice weekly haemodialysis."She has a history of hypertension with periobital and leg swelling and will benefit from kidney transplant as haemodialysis is not sustainable on long term basis and for better quality of life for survival."The report further stated that Ologun would require N10 million as the cost of transplant in Nigeria, or $25,000 for the cost of a transplant abroad depending on the centre for a successful kidney transplant.Her mother, Mrs. Oluwafunmilayo Ologun, who spoke with The Guardian, said her daughter has been on admission with severe pains as she undergoes dialysis, adding that her ailment has taken a toll on the family's financial status.She is appealing to well-meaning Nigerians, corporate organisations, non-governmental organisations, and the government to help save her daughter's life.
