Today, the Items the Aliko Dangote Foundation have delivered include: rice, spaghetti, sugar, salt, millet, maize, noodles, demolina and wheat meal," she said.The Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Kashim Shetima, who formally flagged-off the distribution, thanked the Dangote Foundation for its continuous support to the people of the state, especially to the victims of insurgency.He said: "Words are not enough to describe how grateful the people of Borno are to Dangote and his Foundation, who has relentlessly come to support and share in our plight in our time of need."He asserted that since the inception of the insurgency, the Dangote Foundation remains the largest single individual donor to the IDPs in the state after the Federal and State governments.Also, the Executive Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Ahmed Satome, said that the Dangote Foundation is unique in the sense that it provides all classes of food required by the IDPs in line with the global acceptable standards.While commending the efforts of the Foundation, he said that a total of 371,000 individuals will benefit from this Ramadan intervention.Other dignitaries at the occasion include the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Borno State House of Assembly and other members of the Borno State Executive Council.It would be recalled that following the report, earlier of unhealthy conditions in which the IDPs live in 2016, Dangote visited some of the camps and his Foundation made a jumbo donation of N2billion and hundreds of millions of Naira worth of food items.Within a spate of five years, the total amount donated to various camps of IDPs across the country by the Dangote Foundation has grown significantly to N6.3 billion.
