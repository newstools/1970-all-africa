He described the clashes as a criminal act of groups of bandits and outlaws, not a tribal war.Fighting between Hamar and Kababish tribesmen erupted in the area of Um Marahik over the weekend, reportedly after the theft of Hamar camels by three Kababish on Friday. On Tuesday, government forces intervened with a contingent of about 50 armoured vehicles and a helicopter, and managed to separate the warring parties.In a press statement, the opposition National Umma Party accused the Sudanese government of instigating tribal conflicts by providing weapons to herders' tribes.
