Kaduna &mdash; The recruitment exercise into the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) was open to all Nigerians who met the requirements, the House of Representatives Sub Committee on Air Force has said.Some candidates disqualified from the exercise alleged bias.Speaking when he led his team on an oversight visit to supervise the recruitment exercise, the chairman of the committee, Rep Golu Simon, expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the exercise."Sometimes when applicants are disqualified, they feel it is for one reason or the other, people begin to ascribe sentiment to it, but we are here as representatives of the people, many of our candidates could not make it here and we are happy with the procedure because they were disqualified not for any bad reason, but because they did not meet the requirements." The Director of Recruitment, Resettlement and Reserve, Headquarters, NAF, Air Vice Marshal Gali Abdul-Wahab said many candidates brought credentials they could not defend. "You will see a candidate with chains of credits, yet basic arithmetic is a problem; some, you may be surprised to know, cannot read a newspaper."
