Zimbabwe's revered musician, Oliver Mtukudzi will be honoured this coming Saturday, April 22 at an exclusive event in London dubbed Tuku@65.The honorary gala will pay tribute to the king of music and his illustrious 40-year career; the release of his 65th album and kick off the first part of his 65th birthday celebrations.Several other dinners to commemorate this key milestone are in the pipeline and will take place across Africa and Europe over the coming months. They will be hosted exclusively by event specialists, BlackTie Management.Affectionately known as Tuku, the star arrived in the UK last week Friday ahead of the Southern African Music and Arts (SAMA) tour where he wowed fans at the sold-out event.The music icon is also being celebrated for his contribution and involvement in charitable and humanitarian causes, including his worldwide role as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF."We are days way from one of the most exclusive events on the Zimbabwean diaspora calendar, and we are honoured to be hosting this special dinner for a cultural icon and music legend," BlackTie Management Event Director Zenzo Ncube said."Dr Mtukudzi's fearless and creative spirit has over the years challenged us to rethink certain prejudices and preconceptions in our African culture through his music."He has received several awards in recognition of his services to the music industry and his dedication in helping the underprivileged and vulnerable. It is only fitting that we celebrate his outstanding achievements," Ncube added.The elite dinner will give Tuku fans a unique opportunity to dine with and, spend a one-on-one evening interacting with him, his family and friends."It is an intimate event and we have deliberately limited the number of tickets to keep it exclusive and give fans a real chance to speak to him," said Ncube."There will be a Question and Answer segment with Tuku before he takes to the stage to serenade fans with some classic hits and new material," he added.Speaking on behalf of Dr Mtukudzi, his Manager Sam Mataure saluted BlackTie Management for their role in organising the event."We appreciate, and are very delighted to be in the UK to celebrate Tuku's journey in music, his role as a philanthropist and, to begin the first part of his 65th birthday celebrations," said Mataure."Over the years, we have watched Tuku work tirelessly for humanitarian causes, using his musical gift to both serve and help those in need."It is against this backdrop that we look forward to giving back to him what he has given and done so selflessly for many people over the years," Mataure added.Performers at the event include Wordplay poet, Muunya Usuwuna. The popular spoken word artist started writing poetry in his teens. His first poem Andrew was written in 2012 and later filmed as a video in 2014. He has since performed at high profile events that include the Zimbabwe Achievers Awards and the BEFFTA Awards.Muunya, whose poetry depicts the everyday experiences of life said that he was both humbled and flattered to be performing at an event of this calibre."It was a shock to have been approached to perform for a true music genius. I am nervous but very excited and look forward to sharing what I am most passionate about with Tuku, his family, and expected guests," said Usuwuna.The event will take place at the Waltham Abbey Marriot Hotel in London.Known for its remarkable spa facilities, classic design, elegant style and serene woodlands of Epping Forest, the popular venue provides a breath-taking backdrop and exceptional accommodation.It is just a few minutes away from Loughton Underground Station, providing access to Central London; Stansted Airport and the M25.
