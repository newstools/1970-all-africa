The operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos Police Command and Iyana Ipaja Area Command yesterday arrested 20 youths for instigating and participating in gang wars at the Iyana Ipaja area of the state.The two-day restiveness in the area, especially at the Abule Oki area, was said to have been between two rival gangs over dominance and control of the axis.During the violence, the youths had unleashed mayhem on anything at sight including the rear windscreen of one of the RRS patrol vehicles in Abule Oki, and also smashed the head of one of the police operatives.After attempts to contain the youths proved abortive, the police operatives began to pick up the masterminds one after the other.The arrests were fuelled by Tuesday night's escalation of the crisis when the youths numbering over 100, had set a bonfire on the expressway halting vehicular traffic on the two sides of the ever busy Lagos Abeokuta Expressway.On the ground to quell the violence was the Area 'M' Commander, Austin Akika, who was later joined at the scene by the RRS Commander, Olatunji Disu.After dispersing the youths on Tuesday night, the gang resumed their gang wars yesterday, prompting the RRS team to respond adequately.However, the youths did not give up without a fight as they pelted the police with stones and broken bottles which was what smashed the head of an officer and the windscreen of the RRS Toyota Corolla with the registration number RRS 041 LA.While the RRS officer was taken to the hospital for treatment, the 20 arrested youths have been transferred to the area command for profiling and further investigation.
