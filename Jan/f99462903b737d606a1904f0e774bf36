Journalist Chiko Lawi has apologised for his expletives-laden attack on reggae musician Damian Marley at Jomo Kenyatta International Aiport (JKIA).Chiko Lawi posted a video of the shameful episode on his Instagram page, but later pulled it down.On Tuesday, he claimed the outburst was prompted by Damian Marley ' s comment on his mother.Here is a transcript of Chiko Lawi ' s apology during an interview with Capital FM."At the plane people wanted selfies, he's Bob Marley's son, of course people want to. I'm a big fan.&nbsp;So he was ignoring people and I stepped up.. So I ' m like this is Kenya, these are your fans, people you've come to perform for.A bit of banter and then one of his guys says something like don ' t talk to us, I ' m gonna bust you.&nbsp;That ' s when I lost it. I take my phone out, I was mad and I lost it.Perhaps the words I used were not good, but I was angry, like my mum has nothing to do with this, she ' s in Kitengela looking at her cabbage and chicken. She doesn ' t know reggae, let alone Damian Marley. Plus I don ' t believe in insulting people ' s mothers or their children.To be honest I ' m sorry, I ' m an arrogant man at times, that aside the language, the profanity was excessive. It was wrong of me and I ' m sorry for using the language.Now, it ' s unjustifiable, but don ' t mistake that with me apologising for standing up against someone who is insulting my mother.
