Benin City &mdash; The immediate past Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole and his wife, Lara, Wednesday donated food items and cash to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Ohogua, Ovia North East Local Government Area of the state.Donating the items which included bags of rice, maize, vegetable oil and educational materials, he declared that the task of taking care of IDPs must not rest on government alone, but on all individuals.He said the visit was part of his wife's pet project, asserting that she had continued the project irrespective of the fact that she is no longer the first lady of the state.Oshiomhole who expressed joy that the children were well taken care of, stressed the need for all IDPs' camps in the country to be well equipped with a view to giving the children quality upbringing.According to him, "I am never ashamed to tell people that when I got to Kaduna, I still do remember that after I stayed in a police station for three nights because I have no body there to take care of me, I move into Gwari camp and also stayed there for two weeks before I found somewhere. For my own life experience, these kids, they are all very intelligent, and above all, they are enthusiastic."There's the challenge of food shortage in every camp, but much more than that, they need to be educated or learn something so that they don't lose out. I think here is a model of what is possible with minimum government support they will excel. I think we must recognise that they need the love of every Nigerian not just government for the contributions that would make a difference."This is part of my wife's commitment under her pet project, and we are happy to do more. We are really touched that so much can be done with so little resources. I am happy to see children very well brought up to live a decent life despite their challenges. The current state governor is also committed, and I am sure he will give them the support they need. This is also part of Edo community; it is a core part of the state and like every other part, they will get what is due to them."Speaking further, an elated Oshiomhole, encouraged the IDPs, especially the children, not to be discouraged by their present situation but rather, remain committed to their education.Oshiomhole and his wife further commended the camp Coordinator, Mr. Solomon Folorunsho, for being able to carry on in spite of the challenges in the country.Responding, the Coordinator of the International Christian Centre, Folorunsho, where the IDPs are kept, appreciated Oshiomhole and his wife for keeping in touch with the IDPs even after leaving office.
