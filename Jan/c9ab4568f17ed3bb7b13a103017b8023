Concerned Professionals' Congress (CPC) has lauded the recent endorsement by the United States of America of Nigeria terrorism strategy, describing the move as capable of enhancing and consolidating the nation's image as a leading figure in the global coalition against terrorism and violent extremism.CPC also noted that it would ultimately boost the morale of troops currently engaged in the final operations to rid the North-east of the scourge of Boko Haram terrorism.The group in a statement issued and made available to THISDAY yesterday by its National Coordinator, Musa Tukur Tilde, and the Chief Media Strategist, Emeka Nwapa, was reacting to remarks in Washington D.C by the US Secretary of State, Mr. Rex Tillerson, recently while welcoming to Washington D.C, venue of the World Conference on Global Coalition Against Terrorism, Chiefs of Defence Staff of over 200 countries, including Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Abayomi Gabriel Olonishakin.Tillerson, in his opening remarks while emphasising the need for intelligence and information-sharing in combating terror, averred that Nigeria and West Africa have done very well using synergy, intelligence and information sharing to halt terrorists attacks thereby defeating Boko Haram.He urged countries with challenges of domestic terrorist groups to build and adopt the excellent examples of synergy, intelligence and information sharing system which Nigeria employed to win the war against Boko Haram.CPC, Nigeria's foremost advocacy group, mobilising public support for the military's counter-terrorism war as well as promoting democracy, good governance, maintained that the US public praise of President Muhammadu Buhari's strategy to defeat Boko Haram is highly commendable.According to the statement, "To President Buhari whose uncommon zeal, sincerity, commitment and clear-headedness on how to defeat Boko Haram within 18 months in office, we say a big thank you."To the Nigerian delegation to the Washington counter-terrorism summit led the CDS, General Olonishakin, whose purpose-driven leadership of the armed forces anchored on synergy and doggedness in actualising the President's objectives, we say big kudos."To our courageous and gallant troops and the commanders of Operation Lafiya Dole, both fallen or standing, may God bless you all for doing us very proud."The group pointed out however that it was the entire Nigerian people who the US singled out at the world conference for recognition and commendation.Recalling that not too long ago, President Buhari had received a phone call in London from President Donald Trump who commended Nigeria for her giant counter-terrorism strides, the group noted that at the last 71st United Nations General Assembly in New York late last year there was also an unprecedented endorsement from former US President Barack Obama who openly praised President Buhari and the gallant Nigerian military for defeating Boko Haram."It is worthy of note that these endorsements of Nigeria's successful counter-terrorism strategy by two successive bi-partisan political dispensations in the US in a space of three months is perhaps Nigeria's greatest achievement now. It is our greatest feat as a nation of hope and promise against threats to our national unity, security, stability and prosperity," CPC said.It observed that such endorsement by the US is not cheap, pointing out that the US has the strongest fighting force in the world apart from being the champion and leader of the free world where violent extremism and terrorism pose great dangers."When they cite their experience with terrorists, the world should listen. For President Obama and President Trump to single out our military for special commendation is a headliner. It is a vote of international confidence on our armed forces under the Chief of Defence Staff," the statement added.
