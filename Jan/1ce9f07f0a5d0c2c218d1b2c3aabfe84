The house that Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) promised musician and war veteran Dickson "Cde Chinx" Chingaira is now ready for the artist to takeover, it has emerged.The house was a pledge made by Zima three years ago at its seventh edition of the awards ceremony as a Lifetime Achievement, an appreciation to Cde Chinx.In a statement released yesterday, Zima chairman Joseph Nyadzayo said:"We are honoured to be handing over the Zima Lifetime Achievement Award in the form of a house to Cde Chinx."The statement was accompanied by a video showing the inside and outside of the house.The house will be officially unveiled to the musician who is battling blood cancer at a local hospital on Tuesday. Fellow musicians and arts stakeholders are expected to grace the event.The four-bedroomed house located at 17 Takley Road, Sentosa, Malbereign in Harare had become doubtful given a history of some unfulfilled promised to artists by stakeholders in the arts industry.
