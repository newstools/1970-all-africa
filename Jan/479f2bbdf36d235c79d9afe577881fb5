We really appreciate and we pray that God bless such people. Our lives are in danger," said Massah.The increase in attacks and widespread discrimination coupled with ineffective policing has meant that many of Malawi's population of between 7,000 and 10,000 people with albinism live in constant fear."Apart from being ostracised, ridiculed, denied, being treated as second class citizens and being killed chickens, we need such kind of love and just to know that some people have us and our pains in their heart is a very satisfying to say the least."Amnesty International has since been calling upon the government of Malawi to adopt specific measures to protect the rights to life and security of people with albinism by providing increased levels of visible policing in rural districts and taking action when attacks against this population group occur.
