Africa Film Academy in partnership with the government of Imo State is set to train young men and women who desire a career in the motion picture industry from the state.The three weeks intensive programme which will have master classes will commence from April 25 through May 10, 2017 at Owerri and will feature some of the leading professionals in the Nigerian film industry such as Segun Arinze, Paul Obazele, Tony Anih among others as resource persons.At the end of the training which will cover script-writing, photography, editing, acting, cinematography, sound, lighting among others, the students are expected to produce short films that will give practical expression to what they learnt during the programme.In a statement signed by the organization, the founder of AFA, Ms. Peace Anyiam-Osigwe said that the training is essentially to introduce the prospective youths to how they can start a career in the film industry and technical production and open them to the possibilities that exist."At the end of it we expect participating students to take their interest to the next level through further education in higher institutions and other institutes where they can acquire more and in-depth knowledge. We want to say that the Imo State Government has been kind enough to sponsor 100 students apart from providing venue and other logistics for the training and this is because of the interest of Governor Rochas Okorocha to empower the youths and create job opportunities for them. Diamond Bank as part of its CSR initiative is also sponsoring 10 students to the training while Africa Magic is also a strategic partner to make this a very successful one."Ms. Anyiam-Osigwe revealed that AFA in the last 10 years has trained over 10,000 youths across Africa and seeks more corporate and government support to achieve its target of 20,000 in the next 5 years.
