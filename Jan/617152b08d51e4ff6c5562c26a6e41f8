A visiting American missionary and philonthropist, Annette Llowieski, has expressed disappoinment in a behavior of an Inspector of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) assigned in Mount Barclay, outside Monrovia.Expressing her displeasure on Monday, May 22 when she spoke to reporters along the Monrovia-Kakata highway, Madam Llowieski, who is in the country as guest of the New Hope Foundation Academy School in Paynesville, laments that the attitude displayed by the Transport Ministry Inspector with jacket #013 at the Mount Barclay checkpoint, confirmed a recent UN Security Council's report on Liberia, expressing aprehension about the workings of some government functionary.Missionary Llowieski reveals that while she and the General Overseer of the New Hope Foundation Academy School were on a field trip with primary students of the institution to the Wokee Farm along the Monrovia-Kakata highway, the Transport Inspector, who refused to give his indentify, allegedly ordered the vehicle in which she was riding with the kids parked, demanding documents for the car.According to her, she then asked the MOT Inspector to allow the vehicle to park off the main drive way in order to attend to his inquiry, but he deliberately refused on grounds that the vehicle documents must be produced on the spot before bay further movement.Madam Llowieski narrates that while sitting in the vehicle, the MOT Inspector ordered one of his co-workers to block one of the left tyers of the vehicle to prevent it from leaving the road.She says the inspector, who exhibited no regard for her as a visiting guest, coming to Liberia for the very first time, mandated an officer of the Liberia National Police (LNP) to pull the vehicle over to the Mount Barclay police depot where it slept.She terms the incident as very embarrasing and worrorisome admidst frantic effort by the United States and and other friendly countries to reform civic institutions to conform with internationally acceptable principles.The U.S. citizen then threatened to officially register her discontentment to the security sector here and the United States Embassy about the unbecoming behaviour of the Transport Inspector.The General Overseer of the New Hope Foundation Academy School Mr. Lester Wehyeee, confirmed that the impounded vehicle has all relevant documents, including current license plate.
