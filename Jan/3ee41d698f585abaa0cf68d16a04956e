This is causing a great suffering for the local people," a listener said.Since the beginning of the fasting month of Ramadan, the capitals of North Darfur, Red Sea, and Blue Nile states witnessed a severe shortage of drinking water because of varying reasons: districts cut-off from the water network or broken water pipelines.
