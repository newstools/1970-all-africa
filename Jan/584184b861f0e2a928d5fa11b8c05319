The government and the CBN should treat financial misdeeds as economic sabotage. The laws and regulations should be made stricter and rigorously enforced, he pointed out.The managing director of Highcap Securities Limited stated there should be a stronger resolve and the political will to institute zero tolerance for hanky-panky in the financial system.He however said, the banking sector is very large with operations nationwide and some with international offices and so to control such entities without blemish would be very difficult.This is not surprising that there will be contraventions here and there occasionally but those contraventions cannot materialise enough as to cause problems for the banks' shareholders.The managing director of Dependable Securities Limited, Mr. Chinenyem Anyanwu said there should be a stronger resolve to deal with hanky-panky in the financial system and urged the banks to do the right thing to avoid being penalized.According to him, before CBN or any other regulatory body will penalize, the banks must have committed the offence that is against their code of conduct.Speaking on the contraventions, the national coordinator, Independent Shareholders Association (ISAN), Sunny Nwosu urged the management of banks to be more careful and avoid wasting shareholders' funds. He described commercial bank scontraventions as unfortunate, stressing that the huge fines had robbed shareholders of enhanced dividends during the year.Another shareholder, Mr. Bayo Adeleke, commended the Central Bank for its actions to ensure that commercial banks comply with rules and regulations of engagement.According to him, such penalties should not be viewed from income generating perspective, but to enhance good corporate governance and adherence to standards. He advised regulators to be proactive, while banks should maintain a clean slate.
