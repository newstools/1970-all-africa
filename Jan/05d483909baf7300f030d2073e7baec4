"Where there is rain, they'll go.""But if everyone goes to the same grazing area, clans will try to establish their authority by resorting to violence," he said.GETTING PEOPLE TALKINGNhial Tiitmamer, a programme manager at the Sudd Institute, a research organisation based in South Sudan, acknowledged that working in a conflict-hit country could significantly hamper efforts to build resilience."One day you go to a village and help residents agree on spending priorities to tackle drought. But the next day there is a communal fight and your work is gone," he said.However, efforts to restore a dialogue between clans and help communities adapt to climate extremes - something his organisation is doing as part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) programme - were starting to bear fruit, he said.Key to gaining trust and credibility in people's eyes, he said, has been working closely with village elders from different groups, and making sure they are not alienated.Mamadou Diallo, a deputy project director at Catholic Relief Services, a charity, said that efforts to build resilience should also tackle youth unemployment, which can be a driver of conflict."In Mali, kids who don't have jobs turn to armed groups, whose attacks prevent farmers from travelling to markets," he said. "Give them a job, and you take away their reason to fight you."
