He also thanked the MoHSW for embracing the genuine efforts of all their partners for giving support to the ME&amp;E unit to track progress of their NHSIB.The health promotion officer at WHO, Momodou Lamin Gassama said since 2007, WHO has been providing accelerated support to the MoHSW to put in place a robust strategic planning, policy implementation, monitoring and coordination process for the health sector.Mr. Gassama reiterated his organisation's commitment to support the health ministry and by extension, government of The Gambia and her people in promoting health and wellbeing of the people as articulated in SDG 3.As a leading partner in health, he said WHO is keenly awaiting the signing of the country compact that will facilitate and strengthen health sector coordination of stakeholders for the implementation of one strategic plan, a common mechanism and one monitoring and evaluation system in Gambia's health sector.According to Gassama, the health indicator booklet was developed in a consultative process in 2016, using the new WHO Global Reference list of 100 Core indicators (2015). "The health indicator booklet contains 70 core indicators carefully chosen by the sector, led by a team of M&amp;E experts and the measurement variables for the indicators that from henceforth will be used by the MoHSW and its partners to track the performance of the health system in all the critical programs and support systems and services."
