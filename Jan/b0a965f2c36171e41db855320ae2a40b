Dar es Salaam &mdash; The government has embarked on a process to screen people who masquerade as refugees in Kigoma camps.The move aims at curbing crime and maintaining peace, said Kigoma Regional Commissioner Emmanuel Maganga.Brig Gen (rtd) Maganga spoke on Friday on the sidelines of the launch of a Comprehensive Refugees Response Framework here.The event brought together Kigoma, Kagera and Tabora regional commissioners and the representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).Brig Gen Maganga said not all people entering Tanzania as refugees are to be trusted. "Some of them enter the country with firearms. We have started identifying those who pose as refugees but have other intentions."He also said the government had deployed more police officers at the border to maintain order.Reports show that more than 290,000 people --mainly Burundians -- live in Kigoma refugee camps. More people cross the border every day, according to the UNHCR. Nearly 19,000 Burundians have entered Tanzania country this year.Home Affairs deputy minister Hamad Masauni applauded former President Benjamin Mkapa for brokering peace between the Burundi government and its rivals."The issue of refugees is very complex and it requires funding to take care of refugees. Therefore what Mzee Mkapa is doing is very good to restore peace in Burundi," he said.According to him, if peace is restored in Burundi, there will be no need for them to flee.Mr Masauni said that the government would now look into how the New York Declaration translates into humanitarian issues and development as it fulfills its pledges on the care of refugees. Tanzania's ability to fulfill its pledges depends on the international community, he said.
