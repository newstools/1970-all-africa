Unity Bank has donated relief materials to The Praxis Catholic School for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), and Vulnerable Children during an excursion of the students to the bank's regional office in Abuja recently.A delegation of the school led by the proprietor, Ben Onwujifor, received the items.In a statement issued by the bank's spokesman, Matthew Obiazikwor, the gesture was part of the bank's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), aimed at partnering government, institutions, donor agencies, non-governmental organisations, and humanitarian agencies for the North East rehabilitation."This is a way of reaching out to IDPs to ameliorate the sufferings caused by the insurgency in the region. Beyond our CSR and the bank being in the forefront of private sector intervention initiative in the North East, we have equally kept faith in the North East being the only bank that did not close operations to its teeming customers even in the thick of the insurgency experienced in Borno State," he stated.Commending the bank for hosting Praxis School for the IDPs, Onwujiofor urged Unity Bank to open a dedicated IDPs account in order to assist in collecting voluntary donations from other public spirited individuals and organisations wishing to support the course of the IDPs.He noted that Praxis Catholic School for the IDPs has an ambitious educational programme for its students, and this can be sustained if there is increased assistance and inflow of donations to execute outlined initiatives to fully reintegrate the IDPs into the mainstream of activities in the society."We are grateful to Unity Bank and for the opportunity of the excursion, and we use this platform to call for greater partnership from all well-meaning members of the public to bring succour to the victims of the insurgency," he said.Recall that the Praxis Catholic School for the IDPs was opened in December 2016, by the Nigeria's First Lady, Aisha Buhari.In 2016, Unity Bank supported Borno State Government with the donation of relief materials worth millions of Naira, having also been acknowledged by Governor Kashim Shettima for another donation of N25 million made in the previous years.
