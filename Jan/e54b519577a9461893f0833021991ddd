STRUGGLING pharmaceutical company, MedTech Holdings's fortunes suffered after the company recorded a 26 percent revenue drop to US$9,8 million during the year to December 31, 2016, from US$13,2 million in the prior year.In a statement accompanying financial results, company chairperson, Rose Mazula, said the subdued economic environment had negatively impacted revenue."The challenging operating and economic environment remained depressed, causing demand to remain subdued and resulting in a 26 percent decrease in revenue compared to prior period," Mazula said.Mazula attributed the revenue loss to crippling delays in the remittance of foreign payments.Many pharmaceutical companies have gone for months without supplies due to non-payment to foreign suppliers of raw materials.This has led to losses due to failure to restock."Challenges experienced during the first half of the year persisted during the second half and these included delays by banks in remitting foreign payments, increased competition from unregistered operators and smuggled competing products and changes in legislation resulting in delays in records thus leading to an increased level in lost sales," said Mazula.MedTech is one of the few, resilient pharmaceutical distribution companies that have survived a harsh economy.Delays in foreign payments by banks have led to most pharmaceutical companies sourcing foreign currency on the black market, increasing costs that are often passed to clients.About her company, Mazula said: "Another factor contributing to the dismal performance was the significant increase in finance costs. This was mainly driven by a stronger rand which resulted in a significantly lower exchange rate gain as compared to prior period."The company's auditors also continued to cast doubt over MedTech's going concern as its current liabilities outweighed current assets by US$1,139,243 during the review period, up from US$526,306 the previous year."These factors, along with the other matters indicate material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt on the group's ability to continue operating as a going concern," external auditors, AMG Global Chartered Accountants Zimbabwe, noted.MedTech, a manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceutical products, also bemoaned falling demand for its wide range of pharmaceutical and beauty products.It recorded a loss before tax of US$275,486, down from a US$476,914 profit before tax in 2015.The group's net financing costs worsened to US$58,708, from a net finance income of US$855,73 in 2015. The company has pinned its hopes on on-going cost cutting measures and this has already resulted in a reduction in operating loss from US$378,825 in 2015 to US$216,778 in 2016."Discipline towards cost control and the ongoing cost cutting initiatives have resulted in lower expenses compared to prior period. Margins have remained stagnant," she added.The company's fast moving consumer goods segment that includes MedTech Distribution and Smart Retail recorded a decline in sales of 39 percent due to temporary suspension of trading at Smart Retail from end of February 2016 to June 2016.MedTech distribution sales also declined due to high finance costs.Despite worsening foreign payments gridlock, MedTech's manufacturing segment recorded a growth in revenues of 14 percent over the prior comparable period.In a bid to avoid delays in foreign payments, MedTech grew its local product range by two products, which were previously imported, but are now being packaged locally and the company plans to commence import substitution."Local production of other key lines which are imported by MedTech Distribution will commence in the first half of 2017. Benefits of increased sales and margins will be realised in the second half of 2017," said Mazula.In a quest to increase local production, MedTech is set to commission a new plant at Chicago Cosmetics during the first half of 2017, with the company expecting an increase in margins once the plant is fully operational.Amid crippling liquidity constraints, MedTech says the operating environment remained uncertain and was unlikely going to improve this year."Focus will continue to be placed on maintaining sales and strict cost control," MedTech said.
