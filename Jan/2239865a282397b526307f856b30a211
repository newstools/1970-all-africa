And we want to see diligent prosecution so that it would serve as a deterrent to those who think they can take laws into their hands and harass students who are going about their studies," Enikanolaiye said.A female Nigerian student was attacked on Wednesday, while another five Nigerian students were assaulted on Monday by a mob in a mall. A Kenyan woman was dragged out of a taxi and beaten by a mob in the satellite city on Wednesday, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported on Wednesday.Police said they have arrested five people and booked more than 1,000 suspects in connection with the attacks.
