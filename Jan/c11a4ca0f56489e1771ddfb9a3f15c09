The Lagos State government has commenced investigation into the murder of a fashion designer, Jamiu Ayoade by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Ijeshatedo, Mohammed Yakubu.Ayoade was allegedly shot in the head by Yakubu, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) on Sunday night at 49, Wosilat Daudu Street, Ijeshatedo.But there are fears that the Lagos State police command may be planning to shield the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Mohammed Yakubu, who allegedly killed 25-year-old fashion designer, Ayoade, from justice.The Lagos State police boss, Fatai Owoseni, who spoke to newsmen yesterday, noted that the command was investigating the veracity of the claim by residents that it was the DPO, who killed the innocent fashion designer.According to him, "I still repeat that the DPO's report to me is that he did not kill anyone, but I am investigating the matter and if he is found culpable, I will not shield him."The Guardian gathered that there are plans by the state command to 'kill' the matter in the bid to enable the DPO escape being sacked from the police.The deceased had gone to the venue with his lover to attend his friend's birthday party when the incident occurred.Although the police claimed the DPO and his men went to the venue to arrest suspected cultists and that the deceased was on their wanted list, Ayoade's brother, Taofeeq, denied the allegation, crying for justice.Consequently, Taofeeq visited the Public Advice Centre (PAC) in Alausa, where he made a formal complaint against the DPO and the police.
