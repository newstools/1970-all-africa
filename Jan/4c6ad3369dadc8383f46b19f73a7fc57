Tutume &mdash; Small stock farmers in Tutume and surrounding villages have been advised to monitor the health of their livestock.Speaking in an interview with BOPA recently, the Senior Scientific Officer at the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) in Tutume, Mr Jabulani Maposa said due to heavy rains in the Tutume area, water-borne and tick-borne diseases are likely to be prevalent.He said some of the diseases are heart water, which is a tick-borne disease, foot-rot and pneumonia and advised farmers to monitor the weight and appearance of their stock as this will aid them in knowing if anything is wrong with their stock.Mr Maposa said pneumonia, which is a result of a lung infection could be detected by the presence of mucus and to stop or to minimize the spread of the infection, farmers are advised to keep their stock in roofed or warm shelters.They are also advised to construct kraals in slopping areas as it is easy for water to flow than in flat areas where water stagnates.He further said ticks and worms are also a hazard to small stock as they are parasites that depend on the host for food and shelter.Mr Maposa advised farmers to always de-worm their stock between the months of April and May and that should they suspect that their stock is infected with worms, it is advisable to de-worm them as a precautionary.He said to combat ticks, farmers are advised to apply tick grease instead of dipping as rain washes away the dip and further noted that farmers should consult their office or their inoculators for advice.Source : BOPA
