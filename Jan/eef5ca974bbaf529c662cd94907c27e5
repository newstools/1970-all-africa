For many people who use taxis from Luzira to other parts of Kampala, Twaha Bukenya is not a new name or face.The Kitintale-based taxi stage master last Sunday decided to formalise his marriage, when Shamim Sanyu introduced him officially to her parents in Mutungo, Nakawa division.Bukenya said they have been living together for 24 years - the time he has also worked at the Kitintale taxi stage. Ronald Nsubuga Balimwezo, the mayor of Nakawa division, thanked Twaha for choosing a good wife and staying true to his promise to her."These days in some parts of the world people have turned to introducing same-sex partners, which is against God's will," he said.He said even in Uganda homosexuality was growing in schools, where its crusaders "come with large sums of money to confuse our children".He asked the Bukenyas to be God-fearing and cultivate it in their children too. Balimwezo advised guests to educate their children and for men not to abandon their responsibilities to their wives.Bukenya said he met Sanyu in 1993."I have decided to come to her parents to officially settle our marriage, because we have been in marriage for a long time; we even have grandchildren.""It has been due to our low income that it took us this long, but being with good friends, they helped us organize this function," he said. "I love my wife because she remained focused and managed to wait for all these years."He said, "At first I had two wives, but the other one was a born-again Christian and I am a Muslim. I decided to just remain with Sanyu because we are both Muslim."Bukenya and his entourage brought assorted gifts for Sanyu's parents, proving it is indeed better late than never.
