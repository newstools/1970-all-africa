The two sons were also discharged.They were first admitted to Nanyuki Cottage Hospital but then transferred to Nairobi Hospital for specialised treatment following intervention by the Deputy President.Mr Ruto was on a tour of Laikipia County on March 7 when he was briefed of the shooting incident.He immediately offered his chopper to fly Ms Kuraru and her children to Nairobi Hospital.Ms Kuraru said she was grateful to the DP for supporting her emergency treatment by airlifting her and the two sons to hospital and again for clearing the medical bill."I did not expect that we would be the way we are today after being sprayed with bullets and the fact I was pregnant when the bandits stormed our house."I must thank God that the attack happened when the Deputy President was touring Rumuruti to launch the Kenya police reservist integrated programme. I don't know how things could have been for us," she added.
