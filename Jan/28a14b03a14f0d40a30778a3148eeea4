Not many businesses get to make it to one year; for many, what could have been breaking even sees them breaking up instead by the first anniversary.No wonder then, Buganda Broadcasting Services (BBS) Terefayina decided their first anniversary was to be celebrated to the full. The party was at Maria Flo hotel gardens in Masaka last Saturday and boy, was it one hell of a party. These Buddunians can party!BBS boss Joel Kigozi had said earlier during a press conference at the Bulange-based TV station that they were intending to ensure that the people of Masaka have a great time, because they had received the terefayina with the most enthusiasm.Buganda katikkiro Charles Peter Mayiga was the guest of honor and the people of Masaka did not have any qualms parting with Shs 10,000, which was the door charge.On the entertainment line-up was Geoffrey Lutaaya doing Tuli Luno, plus Catherine Kusasira, Haruna Mubiru, Darx Kartel, Rena Nalumasi and GeoSteady and comedian Jajja Bruce with his film translation antics.However, Kazibwe Kapo, whose latest single Emmundu is a hot item on airwaves did not thrill the crowd. He lacked energy and yet the crowd wanted to see more.Kapo did not have any dancers and seemed to have forgetten that stage performance is all about choreography and engaging the crowd. Just like that, his big moment was ruined.Golden Production's Mesach Semakula sealed the night with his latest single, Totya Bigambo, that had even Mayiga and his entourage on their feet and on stage dancing along.Kigozi said the station will next take the party to Mukono in July at a yet-to-be-communicated venue, before winding up with a Kampala "Crazy party" at Freedom City that same month. Only Eddy Kenzo among the lined-up artistes was unable to make the show.
