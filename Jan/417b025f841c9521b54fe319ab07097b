The fourteenth edition of Dance Week festival, Uganda's premiere dance showcase, lasted more than two days last week.This year, the goal of the organizers was to have fewer productions with better quality for the audience and dance fraternity. Seven performances were spread between April 18 and April 19 in the National Theatre auditorium.With performances involving choreographers Sammie Poppins, Grace Ibanda and Catherine Nakawesa, expectations were high, yet the whole experience fell short."I waited for that magical moment that I could take home with me, but found none," said Sandra Mondo, a computing teacher at Rainbow International School.But besides the lack of thrills, there was a general lack of commitment to dance by the participating dancers. The opening act, Proud To Be Black by Babu Dance Project (BDP), should have been an immersive duet.Led by Victor Papsher Kikuni, a dancer and professional musician from Congo based in Kampala, they had props of African countries portrayed as handwritten names on boxes instead of the borderless expanse of territories they should be.The performance was failed by lack of innovative pattern beyond the Kwasa Kwasa's waist wiggling moves it opened with, and the long piece of poetry at the end, even when it was well-written, threw the audience off.It was delving more into lost identity to Western colonization than inter-African relations, which was the topic the dance had been choreographed to."It looked like something put together in two hours," Anja Gobel, director of Goethe Zentrum Kampala, said.According to Abdul Ginyenya, Battalo East Dance Company and pioneer hybrid dance performer, the festival continues to grow especially with the way they cement their place as a starting point for many of Uganda's dancers below the age of 35 years.Creative pieces including Within Us by Oscar Senyonga of Mambya Dance Company and co-choreographed by Ginyenya showed an understanding of choreographic structure. The opening act of day two included sneaky moments of Bakisimba dance motifs from Buganda.Senyonga, in his passionate limb twists, jerks and hard falls expressed the dark and light emotions he embodies. He carried this to the point of authentic confusion in circular and anti-clockwise movements.An interesting suspended white capsule from which he fell - foil reflector and white cloth - spoke to probably where dance processes and forms should be focused for the coming dance weeks.This year, unlike past editions, Bayimba foundation came on board as partners whose main focus, according to director Faisal Kiwewa, was to prepare the ground for the festival to grow stronger."Our team managed to work for over six months on the festival's online presence - website, social media platforms, communications and calls for artistes and a new logo," he said.The programming and management of the festival was then done under Theatre Factory by Julius Lugaaya. In Him, choreographed by Catherine Nakawesa, was committed to the worded statements of worship at the end than to the dance itself.This was the festival closing performance by Clay Dance Company, a Pentecostal dance group based at Watoto church Central. The near tumbles by the center dancer, where a pristine lotus squat, was the intention but instead made for a very absurdly comical watch.Most of the dance motifs focused on raised hands in reverence at a higher being. Although where the dance failed, the costuming and sound saved the day. The grain of a festival such as workshops and symposiums were also evidently missing."We did not offer free trainings and workshops because we deliberately did not plan them," Lugaaya said.There was a grand lack of commitment to performances by most dancers who attacked choreographic scenes with such sloppiness that arts journalist Andrew Kaggwa wondered whether it was part of the routine in Together Itweena by Kyuuka Youth Outreach Dance Project.It was another showcase that had failed to explain itself and had tried to use poetry to the rescue, in vain.Micheal Wawuyo, one of Uganda's oldest actors, was still waiting to experience something from the stage that would blow his mind; but with Wawuyo's beer freshly-poured, Lugaaya walked on to the stage and closed the festival, leaving many patrons high and dry.The author is a Ugandan arts practitioner.
