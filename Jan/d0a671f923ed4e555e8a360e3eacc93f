Clementine Dusabejambo's film A Place for Myself has been nominated for this year's Africa Movie Academy Awards slated for June 18 in Nigeria.The nomination was done on Sunday, May 14, at the Kigali Convention Centre (KCC) ahead of the official nomination gala, which will be held at the same venue on June 3.The aim of the awards is to recognise excellence and professionalism in the African film industry and to unite the African continent through arts and culture.The final list of the nominees was assessed and decided by the AMAA Jury of 6 judges led by the awards founder Peace Anyiam Osigwe and the jury president Bernie Goldblat.This year's edition will focus on performances in film during the last twelve months on the continental scene under 29 different categories.The annual event has become the biggest gathering of movie makers across Africa and the Diaspora.Dusabejambo's film is up against Nigerian films Bout and Silence, Senegalese movies A Place in the Plane and Marabout, Angolan Kieza, Ghanaian-American film On Monday last Week and Nigerian-British short film Yemoja: Rise of the Orisa in the 'Efere Ozako AMAA 2017 Award for Best Short Film' category.Dusabejambo's film earned her a prize at last year's Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF), where she emerged overall winner."The process is clear and nominations are made regardless of the country from which the filmmakers come. What counts is creativity and quality that match the criteria," said Goldblat.Over the years, the event has been attended by numerous international media representatives, Hollywood celebrities, Nigerian policy makers, African statesmen, journalists, film industry professionals, actresses and actors across Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Caribbean.The Nominations in full:Best Short Film"Bout" -
