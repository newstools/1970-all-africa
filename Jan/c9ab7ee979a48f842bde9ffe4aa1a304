The project was funded from the Community Library Conditional Grant which is made available by the Department of Arts and Culture to provincial departments to transform and upgrade public library services in the country.In her address MEC Leeto said, "Our libraries should help us to preserve and archive our own history using our own narrative. We need to encourage libraries as spaces where information conveyed through new technologies can help to revolutionise and transform our people's lives. We need to equip our libraries with the common foundational texts, that elaborate on our shared African identity and how Africa can take its rightful place in the wider world, so that when our youth meet each other, they can engage with this common and rich body of knowledge even as they come from different places and a multiplicity of cultural expressions."The department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation as custodians of library services in the province has shown its commitment to education and the availability of resources to all communities. This commitment will continue to be displayed and other major projects are in the pipeline. Communities are encouraged to utilize these facilities to their maximum and not to vandalize them.Issued by: Free State Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation
