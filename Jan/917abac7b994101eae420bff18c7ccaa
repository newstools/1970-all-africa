Benin &mdash; BISHOP of the Benin Diocese of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Edo State, Rt. Rev. Peter Imasuen, has charged the Federal Government to tackle the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers across the country by working on the possibility of building cattle ranches for them at their home base.Rt. Rev. Imasuen, who gave the charge in Benin City, yesterday, while delivering his message at the Second Session of the 18th Synod of the Diocese, insisted that while the interest of both parties should be protected, "Cattle cannot just be moving up and down in a civilized society."Cattle ranches should be established in the domain of those whose livelihood depends on cattle rearing and crop farmers should have their farms adequately protected in their domains. This matter is delicate and should be handled maturely and carefully. The Federal Government is certainly in the best position to lead the way."On the face - off between the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government, the Cleric described it as unhealthy for the country' s democracy as he called on them to resolve their differences.On the battle against corruption, he saluted the courage of the government in fighting the scourge and urged it to intensify its efforts to ensure that all corrupt persons were brought to book with dispatch.He called on the Federal Government to create an enabling environment and infrastructure facilities for private sector investment to boost employment even as he urged the government to vigorously pursue the policy of Public Private Partnership, PPP, to provide jobs for the army of youths roaming the streets.The Cleric commended acting President Yemi Osibanjo for encouraging the Federal Government to build modular refineries in oil producing communities as part of measures to addressing the developmental challenges arising from years of neglect.
