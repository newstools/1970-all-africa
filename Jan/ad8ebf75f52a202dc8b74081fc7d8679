Luuka &mdash; In a bid to improve the declining education standards in Luuka, primary school teachers in the district will be compelled to sign a commitment agreement, senior district officials have said.The commitment agreement will, among other things, outline the teachers' will and abilities to ensure that the pupils under their tutelage excel in their academic endeavours.Speaking during the tour of schools in Bukooma, Irongo, Nawampitit and Waibuga sub-counties in Luuka District, the district chairperson, Mr Baker Luwangula, also said pupils in candidate classes will be vetted academically before being allowed to do Primary Leaving Examination (PLE).He said: "We have also suggested that all PLE candidates be screened and those who will not measure up to our required academic standards will be advised to do their exams elsewhere."According to the district education officer, Mr Moses Galandi, the move is aimed at improving academic standards, especially in primary schools. In his ongoing spot visits of the primary schools in the district, Mr Luwangula noted that many teachers are unprepared, high absenteeism and many teachers report late for duty.Over the years the performance of schools in Busoga sub-region and Luuka District in particular, has been dwindling.In last year's Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) results, Luuka District got 144 first grades out of thousands of candidates who sat for the exams. The year before that it registered 150 in first grades.District officials have condemned parents for not supporting their children with scholastic material as well as providing them with the much-needed meals (lunch) at school. This, they said, leads to lack of concentration and resulting into poor performance.
