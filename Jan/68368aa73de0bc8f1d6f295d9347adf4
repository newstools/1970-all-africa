Kampala &mdash; City planners under the Centre for Urban Studies and Research (CFUSR) in partnership with Mbale Town authorities are set to hold the first-ever pioneer street party and festival to promote good governance, mapping and planning for the city.The festival, slated for September 17, is also meant to bring on board the local communities to share their ideas on how to foster development in the area. Its estimated budget is Shs230m with funding from private firms.Makerere University senior lecturer of Urban Planning, Dr Amin Kiggundu Tamale, told Daily Monitor that effective urban management and promotion requires that all stakeholders be afforded opportuinities to participate in the running of cities.'Citizens are rarely engaged in managing urban centres in Uganda. Citizens also lack a sense of ownership, belonging and attachment to local cities and towns. Communities and citizens in towns and cities are also divided along the type of settlement, income levels as well as political ideology," Dr Kiggundu said.He noted that through street parties, carnivals and art festivals, citizens and communities in various towns in Uganda can be united and hence promote urban tourism and diverse city culture.'Few attempts have been made to unite the urban residents, promote urban tourism and instill a sense of belonging in Uganda. The gap between the urban managers and city residents is also still huge in Mbale town," he said.Dr Kiggundu stressed that local urban communities need to be supported to start income generating projects in the tourism sector and participate in events that unite the urban communities.
