Nairobi &mdash; The Appeals Court will on Tuesday receive a report by the clergy-led mediation team on the doctors' strike which has paralysed operations in public hospitals countrywide.This follows a series of closed-door meetings over the weekend that continued until Monday evening when the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials met with the religious leaders.The court gave the parties two days to agree after mediation talks led by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the Kenya National Commission for Human Rights (KNCHR) failed to break the deadlock.Present from the Inter-religious Council of Kenya were Catholic Church head John Cardinal Njue, Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit, Sheikh Adan Wachu and Lodwar Catholic Bishop Dominic Kimengich.The KMPDU team was being led by Chairman Samuel Oroko, Secretary-general Ouma Oluga, and his deputy, Mwachonda Chibanzi, as well as the treasurer, Daisy Korir.
