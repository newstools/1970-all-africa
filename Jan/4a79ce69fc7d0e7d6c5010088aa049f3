Energy giant Eskom has once again opened its doors, this time to the new Acting CEO Johnny Dladla who takes the reins after Brian Molefe left to become a member of parliament and who when he wanted to return to his CEO post, was stopped by the Minister of Public Enterprises Lynn Brown. Dladla has 22 years experience at Eskom, 17 years invested in various non-regulated businesses and 5 years as Chief Executive Officer for Eskom Enterprises and its subsidiaries.
