Lekan Ayinde, Manager of Wale Adenuga Production (WAP) in Lagos, says Nigerian films are not too immoral nor vulgar as being portrayed by some critics.Ayinde said this on Wednesday in Lagos that critics' accusations of excessive immorality in Nigerian films were unfounded."The reality is that what people consider as overt exposures of female sexual appealing figures are really happening in our society."These exposures are not actually extreme."Besides, what we show in our films have global appeal that our government and regulatory agencies do not condemn."Government's regulations support watching foreign films that show these so-called immoral things and this indirectly urge us to follow suit," the manager said.According to Ayinde, Nigerian films score high on ethical issues and conform with the moral ethos of the world today."It will be inconsiderate to ban our films for merely aligning with the things we see and watch in foreign movies."Those who feel that kissing and dressing to expose cleavages of women are not part of original cultures are old fashioned, mundane and outmoded in their thinking".Ayinde said if government did not do anything about Nigerians watching foreign films, then these global tendencies would continue to flourish in indigenous movies.On WAP's latest project, Ayinde stated that "Baba Ajasco Reloaded" would return with a different story line entirely within weeks."The new series is a redefinition of the programme to further its relevance to the current trend".About professionalism in the film industry, the production manager said the sector was becoming more closed to the 'institutionally untrained actor'.He urged professional theatre practitioners to come into the industry to enrich film-making."Nigerian film makers need to change their attitude and the way they respond to social challenges."They should also portray their views of society through the camera and theatre."Generally, our film and theatre industry is not doing badly compared to other developing economies".According to him, the economic recession in Nigeria is a general problem affecting all segments of the society."Without the right money, Nigerian film producers will not be able to engage society for development and global relevance the way they will wish to".
