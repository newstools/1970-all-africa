A few years back, it was said that Africa's creative economy was like a sleeping giant. That may have been, but the giant's awake - and woke - to the fact that the vast digital presence of young African artists is fuelling new and dynamic takes on humour, politics, fact, fiction, sexuality, satire, fantasy, technology, innovation, imagination and much much more.From the visible hits of Instagram to filtered film clips on YouTube, the digital podiums for showcasing visual ideas and experiences have become energised by the uploaded work of artists, thinkers and adventurers who are remixing ideas of creativity across platforms and genres, some subtly, some politically - much of it brash, sassy and savvy - but all of it deserving to be shouted about.This curated selection of some of the most striking digital art and artists coming out of Africa exposes a world that contains movement makers, pivotal names and vital collectives.What's clear is that the ideas that inhabit these platforms are just the modest tip of an ever-evolving iceberg of activity that's as deep as it is wide. With new and established African and Africa-based artists reacting to their immediate and to global locations, the abundance of sharp, edgy, smart or whimsical content exists as a dynamic source of delight, surprise and aesthetic invention, fuelling a rich eco-system of bold and digitally borderless artistic expression.EAST AFRICAArt collectivesThe Nest Collective: A small army of thinkers, makers and believers in Nairobi.Made With Love: Illustrator and art director Musa Omusi is behind this Nairobi-based creative studio, the title of which that essentially highights his own 'philosophy in action'.African Digital Art: The queen of digital art, Jepchumba's African Digital Art portal is without question one of the best online inspirational sources for African creativity, produced by a pan-African network of artists and writers.PhotographyA post shared by ~Wakisha~ (@kishiswakisha) on Mar 31, 2017 at 11:57am PDTBrian Siambi: A one-time mathematician an a by-day graphic designer, Siamba has now turned to documenting Nairobi.Uganda Press Photo Awards: Annual awards that showcase new or established Ugandan photographers and photojournalists in Uganda.Sunny Dolat: Kenyan fashion stylist, creative director and production designer.
