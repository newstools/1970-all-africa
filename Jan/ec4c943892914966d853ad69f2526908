A young Ghanaian engineer, who constantly had to justify her passion for science to everyone she came across, believes that if young women are firm in their beliefs, they will &nbsp;succeed. Leticia Oppong currently works for GE in power services as a field service and technical advising specialist for power plant control systems. She believes that having more women in STEM &nbsp;roles will result in increased creativity, and innovation as products, and services delivered will be informed by the perspectives of a diverse workforce.Leticia said that girls who have an interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers will be inspired to follow in the &nbsp;footsteps of other successful women in STEM and should therefore be exposed to more female role models in these fields.When asked about her experience in a male-dominated field, Leticia admitted that there have been occasional instances of prejudice. &ldquo;Some people see you on site and immediately assume that as a woman, you don&rsquo;t have what it takes to execute the job. Working with such people can get frustrating.&rdquo; Leticia also found that some sites, understandably, did not have female washrooms and because she would have to share with the guys, she had to find ways of managing this.&ldquo;My &nbsp;home country is Ghana, however, I&rsquo;m part of the Sub-Saharan African pool of &nbsp;field service engineers covering assignments within Africa and globally, as the &nbsp;need arises.&rdquo; Leticia initially joined GE in 2013 as an intern with the power services team in Ghana, where during the one-year internship, she was sent to selected sites to work with field teams and to also provide administrative support to various businesses in the GE Ghana office.&ldquo;My &nbsp;interest in engineering had been solidified some time after junior high school. I developed an interest in taking apart electronic devices to figure out how they work and to try to fix them. My father is an electrical engineer and I watched him work around the house. That certainly played a part because &nbsp;I wanted to fix things like he did.&rdquo;Growing up, Leticia knew she wanted to be a scientist. &ldquo;There was an educational programme on TV that I watched quite a lot as a child. It was called&nbsp;The Know-How Show.&rdquo;&nbsp;She was fascinated by the scientific illustrations on the show and this sparked a curiosity that led her to read a book about a power blackout. In the book, there was a picture of a woman in full safety gear on a utility pole. &ldquo;I remember &nbsp;thinking, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what I want to do when I grow up&rsquo;.&rdquo;&ldquo;My father was against me moving into the engineering field from the start. He said a woman had no future in engineering and suggested I study pharmacy. I had to explain to him why I wanted to do engineering. He finally gave in &nbsp;after we consulted a lecturer who convinced him that there was room for women &nbsp;in engineering.&rdquo;&ldquo;My career at GE is fairly young and I&rsquo;m still being mentored. So far, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to attend some university career fairs to share my story with young people who have an interest in the field and hopefully, to inspire them &nbsp;to stay on course. I plan to continue doing this and to take on younger female engineers as I progress further.&rdquo;Leticia studied electrical/electronic engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana&rsquo;s premier institution for the study of engineering. Following her studies, her first training was at the Energy Learning Centre in Niskayuna where she completed the entry-level training for Mark VIe Control Systems. As part of her training, Leticia did on-the-job training for six months on sites in the United States and Nigeria, also attending a leadership training course in South Africa.&ldquo;So far, I&rsquo;d say my first job was the biggest. I was assigned to support on an upgrade job at a site in Japan for two months. The job scope included working on a&nbsp;9F.03 gas turbine unit&nbsp;with DLN 2.6+ and model-based control, and &nbsp;it was technology I had no experience with. It was challenging adjusting to the culture of the people, especially overcoming the language barrier. Thank God, I pulled through and it was a success.&rdquo;&ldquo;I love field work, but there will come a time when I have to make a change so I can grow in my career. When that time comes, I will opt for a role where I can still support the execution of field jobs with the experience I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;garnered.&rdquo;To other young women experiencing difficulty in convincing their parents of the viability of a career in science, Leticia advises them to make a case for what they want. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy, but it is possible. Don&rsquo;t lose your passion or your faith. There is an increasing need for innovative solutions in energy and other infrastructure sectors. A STEM career gives you a chance to be at the forefront of breakthroughs in science and technology that will change our world.&rdquo;
