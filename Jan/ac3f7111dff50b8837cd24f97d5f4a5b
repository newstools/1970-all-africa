Having released the single Tama which is fast becoming a hit, rising hip-hop musician Leroy Kasepa who is affectionately known as Tama in the music circles is set to release an Extended Play (EP) on the 30th of June.An Extended play record, often referred to as an EP, is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album.The 23 year old singer/rapper says he will release the EP on radio and then launch it on a day to be announced."Im going to release a five track EP on the 30th of June and it carries the single Tama which I released two months back. The single is available on Youtube and some digital downloads."I will be doing a radio release of the EP on the 30th. I'm targeting Star Fm, ZiFm and Power Fm radio stations," he said.Tama, who began his music career as a drummer, alludes, dropping an EP is his strategy of penetrating the talent infested Hip-hop, RnB industry."Releasing this EP is my way of penetrating the industry, in anticipation that this time next year I will be releasing an album."As you know they are already people doing the same type of music I am doing," he said.Songs to look up to on the EP include 'Ndatrya trya', Mama Africa, Winner and Mamero which he believes are potential hits.In producing the EP Tama worked with two producers- Ela Bass from Limitless Productions and Chihweda from JP Studios."I did the song Tama at limitless productions and the other four at JP Studios with Chihweda."I sing about the day to day situations that people face, for example on the song Ndatrya Trya I was talking about the current cash crisis hard hitting the nation. I sing trap, hip-hop and RnB," he saidLeroy Kasepa was born was on 4 January 1994 in Harare and attended his primary education in Beitbridge, Plumtree, Kadoma and Chegutu.He proceeded to do his high school studies at Herentials College in Harare and finished his Form four in 2011 and then studied records management in 2012."I started doing music when I was in grade four playing the drum and marimba instruments at Chedonje primary school in Kadoma."So far I have played the drum for musicians like dancehall doctor Freeman, Tami Moyo,Worship Culture, Pastor Josh Kays, Zimpraise, Wellington Kwenda, Wencilus Makungisa, Shasha and many other gospel musicians."By playing for the above mentioned musicians I was creating links and connections, trying to build a name for myself."I began my music career playing instruments because i realized that penetrating the music industry as a drummer is better off than entering it as a vocalist," he said
