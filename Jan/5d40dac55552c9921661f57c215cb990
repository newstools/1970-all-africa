Ahmed Abba, the journalist from Cameroon serving a 10-year prison sentence arising from his coverage of Boko Haram extremists, has won a top press freedom award.The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has named Abba as one of four journalists &ndash; and the only African &ndash; to be awarded&nbsp; its 2017 International Press Freedom Award.Abba is a correspondent for Radio France Internationale's Hausa service. He was first imprisoned in Cameroon in July 2015, spent 635 days in pre-trial detention, then was convicted on charges of "non-denunciation of terrorism" and "laundering of the proceeds of terrorist acts."His conviction and sentence sparked outrage. &ldquo;Ahmed Abba's conviction, after torture and an unfair trial, is clear evidence that Cameroon's military courts are not competent to try civilians and should not have jurisdiction in these cases,&rdquo; said Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty International's Lake Chad researcher, at the time.&ldquo;This is a punishment for the whole press, an attempt to criminalise the profession of journalism in Cameroon,&rdquo; said Cameroonian journalists' union leader Denis Nkwembo.The other winners of the award are: Patricia Mayorga, a correspondent for the Mexico City-based news magazine, Proceso; Pravit Rojanaphruk, a reporter and press freedom advocate in Thailand; and Afrah Nasser, a leading Yemeni reporter and blogger.
