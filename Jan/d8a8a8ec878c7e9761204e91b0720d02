Enhancing the productive capacities of girls and young women has multiple impacts; it boosts their self-esteem, the prospects of gainful employment, and the courage to resist injustices and assert their equality with male counterparts."She cautioned the girls and young women who had been selected from the three counties to be the pioneers and beneficiaries of the project."I want to advise you to utilize the opportunities being afforded to you under this project.""Through this assistance, you assume some accountability and responsibility for success. You must do your part to prove worthy of the confidence demonstrated in you."For her part, the Gender Minster appreciated the partners, adding that the Ministry will ensure that the project is effectively implemented.
