The roots of these trees symbolise each state meeting, mingling and reinforcing each other. Nature, animals and humans will meet under its trees, having dreams and hope for their future with everyone having place and their role to play," Ngomo said.In his remarks, Acting Vice Chancellor of LUANAR Professor Emmanuel Kaunda thanked Egyptian Ambassador to Malawi, Maher El-Adawy who is chairperson of the commemorations for facilitating the choice of LUANAR to host the Africa Park which he said will create a conducive environment for educating visitors to the park.Africa Day is celebrated annually on May 25.
