Jinja &mdash; A farmer in Mayuge District has sued Airtel Uganda demanding Shs300m as compensation for trespassing on his land since 2011.In the civil suit logged at the High Court in Jinja, through Tumusiime, Irumba and Company Advocates and Solicitors, Mr Baidu Mwamadi, a resident of Mayuge District, accuses Airtel of trespassing on his land in Bunya on Block 13 Plot 151 and Kibanja (untitled land) measuring approximately 102ft by 111ft by 178ft by 337ft by 227ft.The plaintiff (Mwamadi) alleges that Airtel, in 2011, without his permission, trespassed on his land by excavating and installing wires, pipes and cables."In the process of installing the aforementioned pipes, wires and cables, my crops where my family derived sustenance, were destroyed such as, sweet potatoes, banana, trees, eucalyptus trees, coffee trees and sugarcane trees causing acute financial loss," the plaintiff claims.Mr Robert Mucwa, a lawyer working with Tumusiime, Irumba and Company Advocates and Solicitors, said they have severally engaged Airtel on resolving the matter but in vain."There have been several attempts to engage the management of Airtel but all efforts have been frustrated until our client decided to take the matters before court," Mr Mucwa said.Court has given Airtel 15 days to file a defence warning that the plaintiff would proceed with the suit and judgment may be given in its absence if at all there is no compliance within the stipulated period.Mr Dennis Kakonge, Airtel's legal director, said they had received the Jinja High Court summons and they were ready to file their defence as directed."We received the summons yesterday (Monday) evening. We are not at liberty to discuss the matter that is before court. But we are going to file our defence and let the law take its course," Mr Kakonge said.According to documents Daily Monitor has seen, a written communication was first issued to Airtel in regard to instituting legal proceedings on January 20.Mr Mucwa says Airtel expressed desire to have the matter settled amicably and on that promise Mwamadi's legal team and Airtel technical people visited the site on February 24, 2017 to assess the level of damage."Our client (Mr Mwamadi) waited for Airtel's response after assessing the damage caused but that did not come to pass until we decided to lodge a civil suit on June 5," Mr Mucwa said.Mr Mwamadi further seeks a permanent injunction restraining Airtel from trespassing on his land.
