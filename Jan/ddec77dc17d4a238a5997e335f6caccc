Micro-blogging website, Twitter, suspended an account run by a faceless social media enthusiast on Sunday, marking an inglorious end for one of Nigeria's most dreaded social media accounts.It was not immediately clear the exact time @SubDeliveryMan was axed by Twitter, but the development was sharply noticed by many on Sunday.Why did they suspend @Subdeliveryman's account though? I just searched for him to catch up on TL drama and no way. What am I supposed to do?- H K Narcissus (@LeTiny_) May 14, 2017What did @SubDeliveryMan do that he was suspended? Did he flog a junior student with iron rod?- Blackanese (@MrThaddeusNG) May 14, 2017Over the past two years, the account became notorious for its vicious intrusion of Nigerians' privacy on Twitter, even as the identity of the individual behind it remained unclearWithin this period, @SubDeliveryMan launched thousands of attacks on individuals on Twitter.The owner of the handle was evasive regarding his or her location, sometimes claiming to be tweeting in Texas only to dazzle followers the next day about how sumptuous a meal he or she bought from a 'mama put' in downtown Lagos was.No matter how vicious, obscene or salacious the assault may be, the account would deliver it to the recipient by directly mentioning their names.Boyfriends and girlfriends looking to vent their anger against each other often found a convenient channel in @SubDeliveryMan.Last June, the account was credited for exposing an affair between Florence Otedola, a.k.a.: DJ Cuppy. and Victor Anichebe, a footballer.Its activities attracted young Nigerians, especially those with an insatiable appetite for gossips who helped push its followers count north of 46,000 before the suspension.But a look-up of the account on Sunday evening showed that many of its fans would have to look elsewhere for entertainment, for now."This account has been suspended. Learn more about why Twitter suspends accounts, or return to your timeline," an error message said after attempts to load the account.Twitter did not immediately respond to PREMIUM TIMES' email seeking comments about the development Sunday night.The suspension had been met with mixed reactions, with as many people lamenting as those celebrating its removal.I pray that SDM account remains permanently suspended, the hate on Twitter increased since we started having something like SDM. - Mazi Olisaemeka &trade; (@OlisaOsega) May 14, 2017Why would anyone want @SubDeliveryMan suspended? He could be rude and arrogant but he play a major role .. @Twitter- monsieur V (@vthe2nd) May 14, 2017I stand with @SubDeliveryMan. There must be freedom before and after speech.- Adeyanju Deji (@adeyanjudeji) May 14, 2017But the account, which made a list of top 10 Nigerian social media handles in 2016, might also be missed for some of the pecuniary and material prizes its followers received.
