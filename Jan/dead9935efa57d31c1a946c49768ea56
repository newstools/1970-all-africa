The electorate from Kogi West Senatorial district yesterday made real their threat to recall Senator Dino Melaye, as they submitted results of their poll to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja.The constituents, who stormed the headquarters of INEC, brought the results in six bags for each of the local government areas in the senatorial district.The local governments where they gathered results from are Ijimu; Kabba/Nunu; Lokoja; Yagba West; Yagba East; and Mopa/Moro.The constituents led by Hon Olowo Cornelius, were ushered in to see the chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu. The press was not allowed into the meeting.Addressing newsmen after their meeting with INEC chairman, Cornelius stated that what was required for a recall was 50.1 percent but they were able to gather 52.3 percent.He noted that polling centres were setup where the electorate came with voters cards to cast their ballot. He explained that it took week for them to collate the results from the polls.While denying that they were being sponsored by the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, Cornelius said they decided to recall their senator because, he had become inaccessible and unreachable and was not representing them responsibly.He claimed that the senator has neither held a town hall meeting in the constituency since he become senator nor attracted any constituency project for them.He said, "We are not satisfied with his representation in the Senate. The people know who is representing them well. The senate is a place for responsible people not for rancour and tyranny. People of Kogi West have had to bear with him for two years.Two years is enough to assess a senator. We are at a stage of a journey of no return."Exonerating the governor from the recall process against Sen Melaye, Cornelius declared that the decision was that of the constituents.He said while it was normal for people to think that the governor had a hand in the recall brouhaha,in reality the governor was not involved because he is not from the senator's constituency."The governor is not from Kogi West, he has no role in the matter. He is from another constituency and he has his own senator. I know people say the enemy of my enemy is my friend but in this case what we are seeing is the determination of the people."
