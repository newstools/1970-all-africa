Collaboration, partnerships, and mergers and acquisitions are critical as the market is disrupted by technology," said Energy &amp; Environment Partner and Business Unit Leader John Raspin. "To drive efficiency and deliver value-adding services in a mature, highly penetrated market, suppliers must harness advanced technologies, adopt business models such as everything-as-a-service (XaaS), and enter accessible high-growth segments such as energy management, performance contracting, and sustainability management."Trends and developments driving growth in the UK FM market include:High levels of merger and acquisition activity driven by service expansion, vertical customer alignment, globalisation, technology addition, and overall expansion of the value proposition;Self-delivery firms increasing bundled services and IFM;Energy management services growth that is set to outstrip the overall FM market, with energy performance shrinking the key growth business model;Data analytics transforming client delivery models and creating value-adding insights for customers and suppliers;Growth opportunities in service innovation due to the convergence of FM with technology and workplace optimisation;Private-sector growth that is ahead of the public sector, especially in commercial offices, the financial sector, and industry/manufacturing; andTechnology-centric Mega Trends that are set to transform FM services in the UK in terms of both service delivery options and customer behaviour. Examples include Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and intelligent robots."Connectivity and convergence mean cloud-hosted analytics will increasingly drive remote management for technical services and preventative maintenance," noted Raspin. "To gain a competitive advantage, FM companies must adopt or develop technologies such as service drones and intelligent robots, while also facing competition from technology firms and original equipment manufacturers."About Frost &amp; SullivanFrost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.
