Dar es Salaam &mdash; The number of Tanzanian households connected to Mobisol's solar systems has gone up by close to 10 per cent during the past two months as the German company expands its footprints across the country.A Mobisol representative in Dar es Salaam, Mr Allan Rwechungura said at the weekend that the company currently covers a total of 60,000 households, businesses and institutions in Tanzania, thanks to its just concluded 'Hamasika na Masika' promotional drive. Solar remains a vital element in Tanzania's energy mix in a country where 64 per cent of households are not connected to the national power grid.The Arusha-based solar company introduced 'Hamasika na Masika' promotional drive in April in the endeavour to bring its services closer to the people and attract an increased number of people, mostly those in off grid areas, to use its environmentally friendly energy products.Winners in the promotional drive received several prizes ranging from solar radios, hair cutting machines and cash.The grand draw - which was conducted in Dar es Salaam at the weekend under the supervision of officials from the Gaming Board of Tanzania - saw a resident of Mbeya, Mr Baraka Mbale going home with a brand-new Boxer motorcycle.At least 3000 people took part in the promotion.The company sells a variety of solar appliances in cash and through loans that can be paid up to a period of three years.
