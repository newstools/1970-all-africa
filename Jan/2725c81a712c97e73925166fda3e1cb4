The 12th official South African National Parks Week has officially been launched at Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) today.The launch was held under the theme 'Know Your National Parks'. The week, launched by the SANParks CEO, Fundisile Mketeni, will end on Friday, 22 September."The National Parks Week initiative was born out of the realisation that the majority of South Africa's citizens were not visiting parks, and with a plethora of activities and wide variety of accommodation to choose from, the week is an effort to cultivate a culture of awareness of and pride in National Parks, especially for those communities situated around the parks," said Mketeni.The week is an opportunity to showcase all national parks as affordable local holiday destinations that offer unique experiences that families and individuals from all backgrounds, cultures, lifestyles and communities can enjoy.During the week, SANParks will once again opening its doors for free from today until Friday. Some of the parks will be extending the week to include the weekend.

The most important birds of prey are the Black Eagle and Jackal Buzzard, as well as the critically endangered Bearded and endangered Cape Vulture.The conservation of vultures in the Eastern Free State has been given a boost by the completion of the Golden Gate Vulture Hide and Restaurant in the park.Free access to SA National Parks will be granted to South African day visitors 16 years and older upon presentation of a valid identification document and Mketeni, said: "The week allows all citizens a chance to freely access something they might not have been exposed to."We especially want our young people to take advantage of this opportunity because this heritage will be under their protection in the near future."
