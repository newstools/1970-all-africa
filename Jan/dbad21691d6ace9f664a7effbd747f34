Opposition politician Joice Mujuru says President Robert Mugabe's "undiplomatic angry outbursts against other world leaders" resulted in the country being isolated from the rest of the world. Mujuru spent 24 years as a cabinet minister and 10 years as vice president until her sacking for allegedly plotting to remove Mugabe from office.
