The British government on Monday called on the Kenyan government to beef up security in Laikipia County where its citizen was killed by herders on Saturday night.The body of Mr Tristan Voorspuy, a dual Kenyan/British national, was found at the Sosian ranch which he co-owns.He had ventured out on a horseback to visit a site on the ranch where two cottages had been set ablaze.RESTORE ORDERIn a statement to newsrooms Monday, Mr Nic Hailey, the British High Commissioner to Kenya said he was "deeply saddened by the murder.""I continue to urge the Kenyan authorities to take all necessary steps urgently to restore law and order, and to protect life and property in the area."I was deeply saddened by the murder of Mr Tristan Voorspuy. The British High Commission is in touch with his family to provide support at this difficult time," said Mr Hailey.He said he had in the past months "repeatedly conveyed to the Kenyan authorities the United Kingdom's deep concern at the situation in parts of Laikipia.""I have done so again following Mr Voorspuy's murder," the High Commissioner said.He welcomed the commitment "at the highest levels" to tackle the situation.The Kenyan government on Monday assured international tourists visiting Laikipia that the conservancies and ranches in the county are safe for safari.POLICE ESCORTKenya Police spokesman Charles Owino said security has been intensified in the county to protect visitors, investors and tourist facilities, including camps and lodges.He added that police were providing escort to tour vans transporting tourists to ranches and conservancies for them to enjoy game drives without fearing for their safety.Mr Owino said so far no tourist has been affected by the ranch invasions by herders.He said officers from the Kenya Tourist Police Unit were also deployed to Laikipia to safeguard visitors and the camps and lodges where they stay."As a result of severe drought, some herders illegally forced their animals into private ranches and conservancies for grazing thereby causing conflict with the private landowners.SECURITY OPERATION"It is against the law for the herders to invade private land. Police have heightened security to protect investors, visitors and property," he said.Speaking to the Nation by phone Monday, Mr Owino said the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet was in Laikipia on Saturday to assess the progress of the ongoing security operation.He said the police boss reaffirmed the government's commitment to protecting property and the lives of residents and visitors.A month ago, herders forced themselves into Suiyan conservancy with their livestock in search of pasture where they burnt down a lodge and cottages.Other ranches and conservancies that have been invaded by herders include Laikipia Nature Conservation, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Segera ranch, Ol Jogi, Ol Malo Sabuk, Borana and Mpala.The ranches and conservancies in Laikipia are among tourist destinations in the country which attract large number of wildlife lovers.
