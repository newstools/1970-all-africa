Atha Eltahier was the Sudanese scorer.Goals from Anis Saltou, Ahmad Ben Ali and Hamdou Elhouni gave Libya a 3-0 advantage by the break.Abdussalam Zaebiaa and Muaid Ellafi extended the lead to five goals before Kelvin Coralie claimed a last-minute consolation for the Seychellois.Another 22 qualifiers are scheduled for later Saturday and Sunday, including two mega fixtures -- Nigeria against South Africa in Uyo and Tunisia against Egypt in Rades.
