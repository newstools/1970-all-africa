"I have received positive feedback from many people and I am confident this time they will enjoy the exhibition like never before. As artists what we need is to be more innovative with our art crafts," he added.The organisers have also scheduled a workshop for the exhibitors to help them improve their handmade products, as well as help them to get market.Different craft products will be on display at the exhibition, ranging from baskets, banana paper craft, accessories, carpets and wooden plates to ceramics products like cups and vases, tailored products like t-shirts, bags, pillows, and table cloths.
