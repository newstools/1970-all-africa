We tried to reach the authorities concerned to alert them of the incident."The Kabal West community leaders know those culprits. No action was taken against them, that's why we have a fallout of the unrest today. But, we are satisfied with the action taken by law enforcement agants," he said."We were told that three people were killed, but, we cannot ascertain the death until after investigation later in the day."Bello Dantsoho, acting district head of Ungwan Muazu, said, "Information reaching me from the community leaders of the area said some people wanted to take the laws into their hands when a body was discovered on Saturday night in Kabala West."They started destroying a mosque in the area in an attempt to generate reprisal action."Another body was also found yesterday (Sunday), which caused this pandemonium and trying to make it a religious crisis, which is not the cause."No life was lost in today's unrest as far as we know, except for injuries when some youths tried to take advantage of what happened."But, everything is under control now, the police and the army are doing their best to restore law and order and we are satisfied with their efforts," he said.He called on the youth and residents to remain calm and not to take the law into hands.Mohammed Lawal, the village head of Kabala West, said the body discovered on Saturday night was found inside a Christian bury ground."What happed was that a body of a 20-year-old youth was discovered inside a Christian cemetery in Kabala West."Instead of the people to allow the law enforcement to investigate, they went about destroying mosques which aggravated the issue."This morning again, we woke up to discover a body allegedly killed last night," he said.He advised security agencies to call for a meeting with traditional and community leaders to jointly investigate the remote cause of the unrest.
