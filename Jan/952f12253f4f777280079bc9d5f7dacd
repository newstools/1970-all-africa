We also used the opportunity to announce our profession, Radiography," the group said.According to them, the campaign was sponsored by ArriveAlive Diagnostic services, ER magazine, Radiography UNILAG Alumni, Victory Drugs and Run for cure Africa.The four health advocates said they would be embarking on another round of campaign June 30th at the Maryland Mall in Lagos, where they will bring the message of prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment to Nigerians.They are therefore calling on stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians to be part of the June 30th campaign through active participation and sponsorship.
