First Republican president Kenneth Kaunda has reminded Africa not to abandon the patriotism that its founding fathers exhibited when they stood by each other to liberate the continent from colonial bondage despite geographic locations.Dr Kaunda said good neighbourliness was the cornerstone that the founding fathers built on Africa and liberated it from colonial bondage, and it was important that the current generation did not forget this component of history.The former head of State said it was important that Africans worked together in love because where there was love, people could overcome any challenges.Dr Kaunda said this yesterday when visiting Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo paid him a visit at his residence in Lusaka's State Lodge area."Our neighbours may be from another region or origin. They may even be from another political party. We are all brothers and sisters. We work together to do our part in God's work. With love we can overcome great challenges," Dr Kaunda said.He said Africans should not allow themselves to be divided on account of colour, ethnicity, language or religion.Dr Kaunda said African countries had in the past helped one another attain independence from the colonial masters, and this mutual support should be sustained in the interest of good neighbourliness.He hailed the Ghanaian leader for his election to the presidency, which coincided with Ghana's 60th independence anniversary.Dr Kaunda said Mr Akufo-Addo's visit would nourish the deep relations between Zambia and Ghana, which dated many years back when Kwame Nkrumah worked to liberate the continent.President Akufo-Addo said the warm relations that existed between Zambia and Ghana symbolised love and solidarity.He said Ghana under his administration would continue to work closely with Zambia to improve existing relations for the betterment of people in the two states.Mr Akufo-Addo said this was living up to the relationship that existed from the days before independence foe the two countries.He said Dr Kaunda was an icon of this generation, and that Africa was one people and that he would work with his counterparts to defend the rights of the people on the continent.
