There is more to finding ideas than going online. I know it is common to be told to make Google your best friend.Sometimes it works, other times it does not. That is why it is crucial to step out of your comfort zone and go out to deliberately source ideas for your next look.I think that partly explains why people who are exposed to different lifestyles, cultures and countries are deemed more stylish than their stay- at-home counterparts.All the influences they meet along the way are combined to make one style-conscious person. Of course creativity also plays a big role here. It should never be a case of copy and paste, because half the time, it does not come out as envisioned.Something about the originator's skin complexion, height or even weight may have combined to make the look tick - attributes you may not have.I bought a piece of African print fabric in West Africa two years ago. It is beautiful. I treasure it so much that I have kept it that long to find a perfect idea and a worthy designer/tailor to pull off the work.Then I arrived at Kigali Fashion Week over the weekend and I was told 19 designers would be showcasing; I knew this was my time. If I could not get an idea or more from 19 highly creative people, the problem was mine.Indeed I got a few ideas that I hope someone will twist them around to suit my style and finally put my treasured fabric to use. I have a feeling that a big number of people that turned up in Kigali like me shopped not only outfits but ideas too.
