Nigeria, home to nearly 20 percent of Africans, households and businesses spends around $21.8 billion on generator fuel to bridge daily power cuts.&nbsp;Ademola Adesina, founder and CEO of Rensource, a West African focused distributed energy services company, believes that by refashioning solar technology as a service, Nigeria, can replace generators with solar technology which would eliminate over 29 million tons of carbon dioxide annually - equivalent to 6.2 million cars.
