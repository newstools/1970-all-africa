The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) on Saturday conducted screening examination for 4,370 doctors and paramedics, who will provide assistance to Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem this year.A board member, Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC), David Atuwo, made the remarks shortly after the exams in Bwari, Abuja. He said the commission resolved to screen members of this year's pilgrim's medical team following irregularities in the previous years and that incompetent applicants would be disqualified."Today it is all based on merit. The board thought it fit we should change the system instead of somebody sitting down in his house and making a list of people to represent the medical team. We felt that merit should take the forefront and JAMB has done an enormous job for us," he said.He said a total of 4,370 medical personnel took the exams out of which 250 successful candidates would be considered."Close to 4,370 candidates registered, at the end of the day, we will know how many sat for the exam. We have 250 spaces, if we are to sit down in our office and put names it will not be fair," he said.The successful applicants would form a medical team that would work with pilgrims to keep them healthy and coordinate their care when they are sick.JAMB Registrar, Professor Is-haq Oloyede said the board's involvement in the pilgrims' exam was within its mandate of testing, which included conducting promotional examinations, scholarship examinations and consultancy services for interested institutions.Represented by Director, Special Duties, Olajide Adisa, he said the examination was fair for all the applicants adding that the questions were set up by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria and moderated by JAMB.
