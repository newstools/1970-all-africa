In this context the Road Development Authority (RDA) has started a resurfacing project, stated the Minister.The underlying objectives of these road projects are to have a reliable infrastructure to facilitate public safety, public convenience and avoid congestion.Minister Bodha announced that innovative techniques such as the milling process will be used to undertake the repair works. This process, he underlined involves a curb reveal process, the removal of deteriorated asphalt and surface levelling. He pointed out that these will lead to financial savings on the cost and utilisation of new materials and also lead to a sustainable use and conservation of natural resources.Following damages in some localities due to torrential rainfall during the month of May 2017, the RDA has initiated various repairs and resurfacing works to address drainage and erosion problems. The resurfacing project concerns approximately 49 km of roads across the country and in this regard a budget of Rs 212 millions has been allocated.Moreover , resurfacing works in various regions including, Vacoas, Beau Bassin, Port Louis, Candos, L'Escalier, Mahebourg, La Ferme, Centre de Flacq, Cote D'Or, Bras D'Eau, Poste de Flacq, Bel Etang , Bramsthan, St Julien, Grand Baie, Petite Julie, Plaines des Roches are currently being undertaken.
