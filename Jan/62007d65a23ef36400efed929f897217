The film, called Krotoa, is still yet to be released in local cinemas but has already scooped eight international awards. The film tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who is removed from her close-knit Khoi tribe to be a domestic worker for Jan van Riebeeck, her uncle's trading partner. She then grows into a visionary young woman, a linguist and negotiator and becomes Van Riebeeck's interpreter. The Dutchman was the first Governor of the Cape Colony.
