Nigeria's Chief of Army staff, Tukur Buratai, has denied reports that he accused international humanitarian organisations, including the United Nations, of infighting and promoting waste in the ongoing fight against Boko Haram insurgency.Reports had quoted Mr. Buratai, a lieutenant general, as saying that the activities of international humanitarian organisations had contributed in sabotaging the military's counterinsurgency effort.A statement issued by the spokesman of the army, Sani Usman, denied that position."This is incorrect and misrepresentation of facts and does not reflect the position of the Chief of Army Staff and indeed the Nigerian Army," said Mr. Usman, a brigadier general."As a matter of fact, the Nigerian Army has been in good working and cordial relationship with all the UN agencies and the NGOs in our country," he said.He explained that the reported allegation "was a result of research work and quotation from news report of a Nigerian news medium that the presenter quoted but reported out of context and without proper attribution to the original source".He said the army appreciated the role of the UN, its agencies and all the NGOs operating in the north east."They contribute immeasurably in alleviating the plight of the Internally Displaced Persons. We would therefore continue to support and assist them in any way possible in the discharge of their legitimate humanitarian duties," the statement said.
