Chi Farms Ltd has partnered with Nollywood to produce a television series that will raise awareness and boost capacity in the agribusiness sector.Courtesy of the collaboration, the company has started to shoot its first mini-series of eight episodes in Epe, with a focus on catfish farming. The series will cover the daily struggles of a catfish farmer in running its business profitably.Besides entertainment, Chi Farms Aquaculture Customer Focus Team will also provide practical solutions that help to maximise the profit of the catfish farming business.Corporate Strategy and Business Development Chi Farms, Johannes Flosbach, said Chi Farms uses the series as part of its large scale training effort for catfish farmers under its ongoing 'Feed the Future' initiative.The series will also be made available online through social media and is expected to be aired on a major Nigerian TV channel.Flosbach added: "Agricultural trainings must be as practical and hands-on as possible. Edutainment clips are a great way to reach large numbers of farmers even in areas where our Customer Focus Team cannot assist directly."The project is part of a larger strategic initiative by Chi Farms to create win-win models with smallholder farmers by providing fish feed, catfish juveniles and water testing kits in combination with certified trainings and regular technical assistance.Executive Director at Chi Farms Ltd, Martin Middernacht, added that "Chi Farms produces highest quality of feed and juveniles. However, farmers need knowledge and understanding to choose the best quality product over the lowest price product."The project is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In return Chi Farms has committed to conducting significant investments into the expansion of its feed milling and catfish hatchery capacities.
