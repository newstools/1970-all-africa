Abuja &mdash; The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has rejected the plan by the Senate to pass the bill seeking to establish the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism (NIHOTOUR).The minister, who was represented by a director, Paul Adelukwu, raised the objections yesterday at a public hearing organised by the Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism.He said the bill, which had passed a second reading, will create agitations, ill-feelings and be unable to achieve its purpose. He explained further that it was not only unhealthy for the growth of tourism, but would interferE with sections 4,15 and 16 that established other existing parastatals in the ministry.The bill had passed its second reading on December 8, 2016, but was referred to the committee for further legislative actions. Though the minister dismissed the bill as overbearing and overwhelming, the Senate maintained that it was meant to put a legal framework in place to train manpower in the hospitality and tourism practices.The Chairman of the committee, Matthew Urhoghide, said the body is an existing institution under the ministry, but only seeking to give a legal backing for its operations.He added that the bill was aimed at providing improved, qualitative services and specialised training, as well as offering diploma and postgraduate courses.
