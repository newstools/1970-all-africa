As the Sudanese Government has still not officially acknowledged the epidemic, reporting on the disease has been outlawed by security authorities. In April, security authorities arrested journalist Ammar El Daw, the El Gedaref correspondent of El Sayha newspaper, who published an article relating to cholera. Our sources may therefore be subjected to harassment and intimidation for speaking to Radio Dabanga.
