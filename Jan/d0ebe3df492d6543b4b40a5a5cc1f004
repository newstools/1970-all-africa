EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) and UK government have spent six million euro and 30 million pound respectively. The government of USA has also pledged support.Ethiopia's government has been working to strengthen its support while respective regional governments are also playing their utmost role in countering the effect.According to Mitiku, the commission plans to make use of the Belg (autumn) season's production to be harvested in the next two months.It is expected that the country would harvest about 345 million quintal agricultural products from over 13 million hectare of land in the belg season, said Bahiru Setegn Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resource Public Relation Expert.Prior to the onset of the season, the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources has distributed about 13.8 and 1.4 Million quintals of fertilizer and selected seed of maize and wheat at reasonable price, he said.As to Bahiru, the ministry has also distributed various machineries including combiners to farmers so as to carry out the harvesting process as fast as possible.
