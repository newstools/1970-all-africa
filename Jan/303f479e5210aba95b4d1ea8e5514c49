Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been urged to remain financially disciplined by spending within their means if they are to gain a competitive edge in the market and grow their businesses into large entities.Speaking recently during the entrepreneurs' business clinics session targeting progressive entrepreneurs, Charles Ocici, the executive director of Enterprise Uganda, said SMEs need to ensure proper financial soundness and stability of their respective enterprises through improved financial discipline that will enable them maintain lean cost structures, strong balance sheets and sustainable profits.He added that most Ugandan businesses remain micro for years mainly because of poor cash management, which constrains business growth and sustainability."It is easy for anyone to be pushed into starting a business but sustaining it in the market is difficult, especially when the entrepreneur has poor financial management skills. Cash is the lifeblood of enterprise and without it, a business cannot survive," Ocici said.He added: "Once your cash outflows exceed the inflows, it is just a matter of time before you face financial challenges because you are spending more than you generate."Ocici further explained that "proper financial management skills enable entrepreneurs adapt to the changing business needs while helping them reduce costs and make smarter investment decisions and innovation," he said.Although the 2014 Global Entrepreneur Monitor report rated Uganda as the world's most entrepreneurial country, with a rate of 28.1 per cent, over half of the businesses collapse before their second anniversary.Though limited access to finance has always been blamed for the high SME failure rate, poor financial management and lack of proper bookkeeping are also emerging as big threats to their survival, according to Daniel Kaggwa, the country manager for Business Partners International (BPI).Louis Kasekende, the deputy governor, Bank of Uganda, in a separate forum, also alluded to the need for proper financial management skills, saying that it is paramount for the survival of any business."The economy is dominated by the micro and small enterprises, which provide employment to more than 90 per cent of the workforce. However, they face several barriers to growth and the majority remain small because of poor financial management," he said.Prof Waswa Balunywa, the principal, Makerere University Business School, also noted that the only way SMEs can survive the current economic headwinds and stay profitable is by adopting proper financial management skills.Balunywa added that proper financial management is at the heart of running a successful business, adding that it affects every aspect of a business, from managing cash flow and tracking business performance to developing plans to ensure that businesses tap the opportunities.
