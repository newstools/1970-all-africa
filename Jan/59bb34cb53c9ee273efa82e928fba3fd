The power cuts also made it difficult for residents to do their evening shopping to buy Eid supplies as the fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.Hundreds of displaced families have been left destitute (RD Correspondent) Residents of Kalma camp survey the destruction (RD Correspondent) Calma camp floods (RD Correspondent) Making a start to the clean-up and repair operations (RD Correspondent) Drying sodden food stocks (RD Correspondent)
