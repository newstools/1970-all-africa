Dutse &mdash; Former Jigawa State governor Sule Lamido yesterday said the quit notice given to Igbo to leave the North by a coalition of some northern groups is scary because of what it may lead to.Lamido made the assertion in his Bamaina country home while hosting his supporters to breaking of Ramadan fast, saying such statement could easily undermine the already fragile unity of the country.The former governor who recently declared his aspiration to run for the presidency under his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), accused the present leadership of lack of capacity to maintain the unity of the country.He blamed the media over how it has been portraying the ultimatum, saying, "There are things we shouldn't write because of their consequences."It is easier to say pack and leave but would our leaders be able to contain the consequences that may ensue?" he asked.
