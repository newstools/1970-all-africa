Our ambition is not to withdraw or divest but to grow with all our strength."We are presently developing our solar business with ambition to cover all the different parts of the solar business. We are selling Awango lamps to individual customers; we have sold more than 300,000 lamps in the last two years. We target at reaching 400,000 lamps at the end of 2017."So it is half a million by next year. We are also looking at developing solar into a big business, helping our industrial customers to develop solar solutions hybrid together with their existing power generation system either electricity system or generator. We identified that as a major act of development of our business."Mittelman told the shareholders that Total would continue to invest in its lubricant facilities, as well as improve the depots and logistics, noting that this year would be challenging, but assured that the company would continue to grow in all indices for enhanced shareholders' value, and improve customer service delivery.The President Emeritus, Independent shareholders Association of Nigeria, Sunny Nwosu, commended Total for the improved performance in 2016, while urging the company to consider a bonus issue for shareholders in the current financial year.He also stressed the need for the oil company to consider producing solar energy that would be lower in price than what is currently obtainable in the market for the benefit of all stakeholders.
