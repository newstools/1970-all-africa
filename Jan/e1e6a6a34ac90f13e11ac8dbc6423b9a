The OAU Alumni Association in Liberia in collaboration with the Africa Center of Excellence has launched a scholarship program for postgraduates to harness science and technology to enhance national development in Liberia.The Obafemi Awolowo University-Information Technology-Driven Knowledge Park (OAK-Park) in Ile-Ife, Nigeria was established as a regional hub for the utilization of the existing infrastructure and the accumulated knowledge for the benefit of the society at large.In a release issued Tuesday in Monrovia, the group said the OAK-Park aims to create a regionally recognized and acknowledged model that is driven by high quality post-graduate education for uptake and commercialization of research and technology to advance the growth of ICT industry.The group indicated that the center has served as a launch pad for start-up companies borne out of university research activities in partnership with collaborating ICT companies, who will have competitive advantage of proximity and direct access to the intellectual infrastructure and output of the university.According to the group, the center, also is to ensure systematic incubation of research ideas and products from OAU and other partner HEIs such that the creative/innovative energy of the talented youths is harnessed into ICT entrepreneurial endeavors using appropriate skill-enhancing training and mentoring."OAU is undoubtedly the leading ICT University in Nigeria. Established in 1962 in the ancient city of Ile-Ife as a university dedicated to the promotion of learning and culture, he mission was to promote by research and other means, the advancement of knowledge and its practical application to social, cultural, economic, scientific and technological problems; to create a conducive teaching and learning community for imparting skills, knowledge, behavior and attitude, advance and protect the independence of the academic enterprise, engender a sense of selfless public service and promote African culture and traditions," the group added in the release.
