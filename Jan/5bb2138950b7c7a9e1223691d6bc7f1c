We believe that for creativity to grow there needs to be a platform that supports and promotes its growth", Ademiluyi added.In exploring the multifaceted achievement of Africa fashion globally, the adoption of African fabric and designers' creativeness into the heart of IKEA (the world's biggest furniture and homeware store) is an undeniable testament of the untapped potentials of Africa fashion as a catalyst for economic development, bilateral engagement, cultural potency, and intellectual superiority of the African continent. As IKEA's design manager Marcus Engman stated, "'the creative explosion which is taking place in several cities around Africa right now is something IKEA is curious about and we want to learn from this and spread it to the rest of the world. Working together with these designers and creatives gives us the opportunity to do so". That is why AFWN will continue to be in the forefront of promoting and nurturing Africa talents to fulfil their potential.
