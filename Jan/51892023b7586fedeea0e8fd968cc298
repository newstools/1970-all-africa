Music festivals have since become a big thing on Uganda's entertainment scene; no wonder Tusker Malt and House of DJs have decided to change the feel of Blankets and Wine to one of an arts festival.The quarterly picnic setting happening for the 17th time this weekend at Lugogo Cricket Oval is fast morphing into a music festival of sorts without necessarily adding the word 'festival' to the brand's name.The lineup and sneak peek provided by the sponsors in an official statement says it all. Performing on the stage will be Muthoni the Drummer Queen, Daniel Lemma &amp; Hot This Year, Fena Gitu, Kager Mungai, Pelindah, Byg Ben, Apio Moro, Joash, Mayonde, Essie, DJ Beekay, DJ RPM, DJ Rachel and the main acts of Cindy and Afrigo band.This is the biggest lienup since it was started in Kampala. Usually it is around four acts with the in-house DJ, Bankrobber. The lineup is set to cater for different attendees' palates with most of the artistes making a debut.In Cindy, revellers should expect an electrifying performance as shows off her ever-energetic dancehall moves. Byg Ben, on the other hand, will be hoping this stage will grow him from the king of the East when it comes to hip hop, to a national act.The timeless Afrigo band will once again be back to share with their fans a more than 40-year musical experience with new and old music. Many will look to dance to some of their classics such as Sikulimba, Tony, Nnemeddwa, Sipiidi and Nantongo, among others.Maureen Rutabingwa, the brand manager, Tusker Malt Lager, said, "The Blankets and Wine Kampala experience only keeps getting bigger and better.We now look to add a twist to the fan-filled experience by providing our consumers with more acts and an extended performance time. The lineup is composed of outstanding musicians in the emerging genres of afro-based music."
