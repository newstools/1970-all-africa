Talk show panellists Cindy Ogana and comedian Butita always poke fun at each other on NTV's The Trend, but on a recently aired segment, fans thought Ogana went too far with her jokes.Fans took issue with the Hot 96 radio host for likening Butita to dark Kenyan made dolls and accused her of colourism."There are too many racist remarks on a live show deemed as jokes," wrote Robert Sato on YouTube while Naomi Gathuo thought "Cindy calling Butita black is like the kettle calling the pot black."Njuguna Vision asked; "Do these guys realise they are all the same complexion? The joke is on you all."Through their comments, other fans seemed hurt and upset that Butita always gets picked on because of his complexion."Constantly picking on Butita because of his skin colour is getting really, really old... I mean how long can a human being take the same joke over and over again about something he cannot change? Just because he hasn't expressed it doesn't mean it's not getting to him. It's surprising that the rest of you all and the directors of the show are still seeing it as appropriate and keep doing it on basically every show," Julia Kibuga said.Blair Santillana wrote "Please stop with the skin colour jokes towards Butita. They are not funny, but quite insulting especially when the two of you are literally the same shade."However, the comedian is far from offended and tells Showbuzz that it is all in good fun."I make fun of her too. We have fun on the show, we know what we can and cannot say. It's not a big deal," he said.
