Kennedy Airport, US Homeland security issued threats to obtain American citizenship or risk being constantly interrogated. He termed the action as illegal."I have never had an experience as I did recently at the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City."Returning from the oversea, while in the entrance line at the JFK Airport, I was pulled off the line and taken to a room where other travelers were at which time I was issued threats and interrogated," Davies asserted.According to him, after being brought to a room, an officer only identified as Chen, believed to be on border patrol, threatened to arrest him if he talked about his misfortune."I remain silent and waited to understanding the nature for why I was detained and after a few hours, Officer Chen called me to his counter desk and started to ask me irrelevant questions, which he should have had the answers since my residency card was just renewed.I was finger-printed by the Immigration Services as a requirement to renew my green card.Furthermore, I am an educator who teaches within the United States of America and I am fingerprinted every time by the institutions that I am working with as a requirement for employment," he noted.He said he was told that he would lose his green card if he doesn't become an American citizen."My country, Liberia does not have dual citizenship it hurts me to choose between the two countries. I love Liberia and I have interest in the United States of America because my children, nieces and nephews are Americans," Davies lamented.He explained that he had been a legal resident of the United States of America since October 22, 1992 and has, in recent time, renewed his green card which is expected to expire on September 22, 2024."Since the issuing of my residency card, I have been able to travel out of the United States of America five times which includes, 1997, 2005, 2008, 2013, and 2016."According to him a letter of complaint with addressed to the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security in Washington DC (20528) John F.
