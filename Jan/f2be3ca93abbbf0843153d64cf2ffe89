Lokoja &mdash; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said that his administration will not condone "politics of violence" or any form of criminality from any person or group in the state.The governor, who spoke yesterday through his Director General on Media and Publicity, Kingsley Fanwo, was reacting to the parading of the Administrator of Ijumu Local Government Area, Taofiq Isah alongside five others by the police in Abuja, over the recent assassination attempt on Senator Dino Melaye.He said the state government would refrain from any form of involvement in the case in order to allow the police conduct investigations.Fanwo, however, called on the police to ensure "strict adherence to rule of law" and ensure "the administrator is afforded every facility to prove his innocence of these serious allegations and return home to his family and his duties."He also said, "The public can therefore rest in the assurance that there will be no hiding place within the administration, or in Kogi State for that matter, for anyone who, for any reason whatsoever, resorts to the old and discredited ways of crime and violence in politics which we inherited and have since dismantled."We make it crystal clear that swift retribution will fall on anyone proven to have planned or participated in any attempt on the life of anyone within the boundaries of Kogi State. There will be no sacred cows," the statement said.
