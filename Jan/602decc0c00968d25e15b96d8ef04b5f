Jinja &mdash; Jinja Municipality Council has closed most buildings on the Main Street over failure by landlords to pay property tax.Businesspeople who turned up to transact their business last week found their shops closed with a seal and a document saying legal action would be taken in case the seal is removed."These premises have been closed due to failure to pay property tax; please make sure you clear all your dues to zero balance. Failure to clear all dues shall warrant the council to take legal action against you, and any attempt to interfere with the seal shall result into prosecution of the culprit in courts of law," the document reads in apart.More than 200 business owners of retail shops, restaurants and pharmacies are now counting losses after the operation to crack down on defaulters of property tax.Mr John Kakaire, a retail shop owner, said he has incurred losses yet he paid for the trading licence and cleared the landlord.Jinja Municipality public relations officer Rajab Kitto said the operation is meant to recover Sh500m in uncollected property tax for the last two financial years. "The property tax arrears for the last two years are Shs500m so we have to close these buildings to enable us recover the money so that we can deliver the services to residents of Jinja."We have been sending these demand notes to defaulters but they are adamant; they have to pay if they want us to open their buildings,"Mr Kitto said.He added that the operation is ongoing and they have organised their legal team to take to Court whoever removes the seal without clearing the arrears.He urged the owners to pay property tax because the exercise will continue to enable them raise money to extend services to people such as garbage collection and street light installation."For all the garbage we generate from this town, we use property tax to pay contractors especially in the central division," he saidHe added: "If people are demanding for services then they should be able to pay to enable us work on roads and street lights."About property taxProperty tax is the tax payable on either the income arising from the sale or rental of property or on the transfer of property.
