He is not a man to be ignored at any gathering. He commands respect wherever he goes. Juju music legend, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey's soft, velvety voice and philosophical songs have endeared him to many Nigerians. For over 50 years, the chief commander as he is widely known, toured the world with his Miliki sound and commanded so much attention. Later in life, he became renowned for Christian spiritual themes in his music and has since the early-1990s retired into Nigerian gospel music ministry.As he turns 75, PREMIUM TIMES chronicles his music career, his many achievements as well as his impact on the Nigerian music scene.The beginningHe was born in 1942 at the Island Maternity in Lagos. Immediately after he was born, his mum took him back to Idogo in Ogun State where he spent his early childhood. His father was a carpenter while his mother sold clothes. Obey was born in peculiar circumstances, as his mother, Abigail Oyindamola Fabiyi was barren for about two decades as a married woman. Thrown out of her matrimonial home upon the counsel of her former husband's family, she was advised to go to Idogo village away from the face of agony and despair. She bore two children for her second husband: Ebenezer Obey and his late sister.Personal lifeHe was married to Lady Evangelist Juliana Obey-Fabiyi for 48 years. They wedded in 1963. She was a frontline businesswoman and poultry farmer. Obey met her at his friend's house -- her brother. In an interview, he was quoted as saying that immediately she entered the sitting room, he told his friend that she was his wife. She passed on in 2011 at 67. Four of his children are pastors while two of them are musicians.His foray into musicAs a boy, Obey started his musical career in Idogo by singing on errands to cover distances. His mother enrolled him in the choir at the Methodist Church, Idogo, a move that inspired his music career. His musical talent was recognised early on when he was asked to lead the band at his Methodist Primary School. This was where he honed his music skills. He formed his first band in the 1957, called Royal Mambo Orchestra. He moved to Lagos and continued his music career with two elderly men, Akinyomi Savage and Bamgbose Jumoda, alias Abengo Mayana. His band mates introduced him to the late Fatai Rolling Dollar, who would become his bandleader for about six years. He formed a band called International Brothers, in 1964. Soon they had a hit juju single "Ewa Wowun Ojumi Ri." The band played a fusion of highlife and Juju music. In 1966, Obey's chief juju rival, King Sunny Ade came on the scene, and they still maintain a friendly rivalry today. The band later metamorphosed into Inter-Reformers in the early-1970s, with a long list of Juju album hits on the West African Decca musical label.A fulfilling music careerEbenezer Obey, who debuted in 1964 and became famous with Olo Mi Gbo Temi (1966), further modernized juju by drawing on highlife, and his lengthy jams. Some of his notable tracks include Mo Tun Gbe De (1973), Operation Feed The Nation (1976), Adam and Eve (1977), Current Affairs (1980), Je Ka Jo (1983).He has released over 100 albums while the ones that are yet to be released are uncountable.Although he plays highlife juju music, his Miliki sound which he describes as a sound of enjoyment has set him apart from the pack.Embracing ChristObey, however, is also renowned for Christian spiritual themes in his music and has since the early-1990s retired into Nigerian gospel music ministry. He is the general overseer of Decross Gospel Mission located in Iyana Ipaja in Lagos.He heeded God's call in early 1990s at the peak of his career. He birthed a Christian ministry and abandoned a prospering secular musical career to become an evangelist.
