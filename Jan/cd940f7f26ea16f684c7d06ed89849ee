These advertisements are part of a campaign against drunk driving and walking, and use languages and images that seem to represent certain South Africans, specifically in the Western Cape. On the one hand, they could be criticised for stereotyping some groups as drunken gangsters, appropriating slang - "Don't be dof (stupid). Alcohol and roads don't mix. My bra (friend)."- and showing the Xhosa word meaning evildoers/witchcraft. On the flipside, they could be an effective way of getting people to identify with the characters, and in this way pay more attention to the message. What do you think?
