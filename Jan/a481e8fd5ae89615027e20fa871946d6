Each of the groups received between Shs3 to Shs5 million.The Butaleja Resident District Commissioner, Mr Richard Gulume Balyaino, said: "The beneficiaries have failed to pay back the money, which is unfortunate."He said some of the YLP beneficiaries are on the run.Mr Gulume made the remarks while handing over a cheque of Shs167 to women groups in Butaleja District under the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship programme.Funding stoppedMr Gulume said the government had stopped sending YLP funds to Butaleja after the district failed to recover the money it sent earlier."The district has missed getting about Shs450 million for this financial year. The government decided that those who didn't recover at least 50 per cent of the money will not get more money for YLP," he said.He urged YLP and Uganda Women Entrepreneurship programme beneficiaries to use the money to start income generating activities.The district youth chairperson, Mr Nicholas Higenyi, said: "We passed a resolution to arrest such youth with aim of recovering the money. But we are still failing to get them," said Mr Higenyi.He added: "The plan was for the groups to take the money, use it and refund within 12 months without interest. But instead they misused the money and ran away."
