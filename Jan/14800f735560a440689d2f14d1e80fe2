It's really exciting to be here at this time when African music is taking over the world and I feel like I have been welcomed so well. Thank you to everyone who has helped made this process so amazing and confortable - I really feel like I am home," adding, "The creative and music process has been very cool. I think a lot of people don't really know about the depth of African music and how it varies from country in country here in Africa and it's been really cool for me to dive into the sounds of different artistes from different countries here."Two acclaimed African music producers: DJ Maphorisa (South Africa) Masterkraft (Nigeria) will be producing all the music of the Global Fusion Edition. All the music will be performed and recorded live alongside Coke Studio's highly talented house band. The new season is set to premiere in different regions from September this year and will broadcast in more than 30 countries across Africa.
