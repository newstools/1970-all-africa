In addition, the Minister of Gender Children Social Protection, Julia Duncan Cassell said the ministry is delighted to collaborate with the World Bank group, and the Liberia country office in the launch of the GERLS project.She affirmed that it is an important milestone as it is one of the government response programs to reduce suffering caused by the debilitating effects of EVD on the economy.Cassell indicated that the project aims at providing life and business skills training to support the re-entry and participation of targeted adolescent girls into the labor market.She mentioned that the program will provide income support to adolescent girls who have lost their livelihoods as a result of the EVD crisis in Liberia. The Gender Minister explained that it is important to focus on adolescent girls because during the EVD crisis in 2014, the MGCSP conducted a telephone call campaign among ,080 EPAG Which Was Intended to Assess Girls well-being and to let them know that the Ministry was concerned about them. The West African Ebola virus disease crisis has been describing as the biggest outbreath in history.In addition, the project manager of the GERLS project, Vivian Neejay Innis stated the need to eliminate the culture of dependency by investing in adolescent's girls through livelihood support and business skills something that will help in Liberia's reform process.She narrated that women in Liberia constitute a huge portion of the population therefore their inclusion in economic development lies at the heart of sustainable development in every way conceivable, but realizing this goal fundamentally depends on realizing economic rights and also looking at sustainability in national context which requires transformation power relations and structural inequalities in different sectors of the economy.Neejay further emphasized that the project will support the ultimate goal of strengthening the country's safety net system and its ability to respond to shocks and increasing the resilience of poor households that have been adversely affected by EVD outbreak, as well as promoting inclusive economic growth in Liberia.The world health organization reported 24,282 cumulative cases by early march 2015. Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have accounted for nearly all 99.8 percent EVD cases.Liberia reported about 38.5 percent of the cumulative cases in the region, according to WHO 2015 report. The Ministry of Health had reported 9,800 cumulative cases, with a case fatality rate of 44.2 percent of the GERLS.The African Development Bank (AFDB) has established that women constitute 50 percent of agriculture labor force in sub-Sahara Africa and contribute immensely to food security on continent.For example, Ethiopia is the largest producer of coffee in Africa and women make up 75 percent of the coffee industry which gives them control over 43 percent of the revenue.Injection of cash in women owned businesses is a moral imperative to improve the quality of life in Africa, particularly in Ebola affected countries.
