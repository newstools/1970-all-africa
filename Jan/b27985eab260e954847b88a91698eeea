Lagos &mdash; Nigerians travelling to the United States will start enjoying laptop and tablet handling service on Emirates flights.The United Arab Emirates flagship carrier said it would introduce a new service to enable customers use their laptops and tablet devices until just before they board their flights to the US.The airline said its customers travelling to the US via Dubai would be able to utilize their laptops and tablet devices on the first part of their journey, and also during transit in Dubai."They must then declare and hand over their laptops, tablets, and other banned electronic devices to security staff at the gate just before boarding their US-bound flight. The devices will be carefully packed into boxes, loaded into the aircraft hold, and returned to the customer at their US destination. There will not be any charge for this service", the airline said.The new measure is in response to US President Donald Trump's ban on airline passengers from eight Middle Eastern and North African countries from carrying large electronic devices.
