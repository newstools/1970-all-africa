The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has called on the Federal Government to shelve its planned harmonisation of salaries of health workers in the country.The association's position is contained in a communiqu&eacute; issued by Dr Mike Ogirima, President of NMA, yesterday at the end of the 57th Annual General Meeting and Delegate Conference of the association, held in Calabar, from April 24 to 29 .It noted although health workers faced many hazards in the discharge of their duties, their output could not be compared to doctors, who performed the bulk of the medical services."There is an attempt to harmonise the salaries and the Federal Ministry of Health is at the lead of that attempt, which is currently causing a lot of disharmony in the health sector."Medical doctors are highly skilled and few in the country; the cut-off mark for medical students now is 280 and above. Everybody wants to accept that title of doctor in the medical set up; we are not against that."What we are against is the fact that everybody cannot be equated to be equal. In the animal kingdom, all animals are equal; but some are more equal than others," it said.The association said that it was not against moves to enhance the welfare of other health workers, but insisted that relativity should be maintained."We are not saying that the welfare of other medical workers should not be taken care of, but that relativity should be maintained when we talk of salaries of health workers in the hospitals."The NMA is calling on government to evaluate different professionals in the health sector and audit the output they put at work."With that, there will be more objective data and statistics to buttress our point, asking for maintenance of the relativity," it added.
