The Federal Government has banned Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) from transacting business with companies and other corporate bodies that are not duly registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission.A circular from the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation said the measure is aimed at protecting MDAs from entering contractual obligations with fake or unregistered companies, even as the Minister of Finance warned that payments for contracts by companies that did not comply with the requirements may not be considered.A statement from the Director (Information), Ministry of Finance, Salisu Na'inna Dambatta, said for companies and other corporate bodies to qualify for business transactions with MDAs, their letterhead must bear the registration number as issued by the Corporate Affairs Commission with contact telephone numbers, valid e-mail address and official company address as well as the names and nationalities of directors of the company at the bottom of the letter heading.
