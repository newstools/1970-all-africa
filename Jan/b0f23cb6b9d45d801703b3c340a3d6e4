"Stakeholders must encompass the vast changes in adjunct technologies that will impact customer care, including Big Data, Internet of Things, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), video, and augmented reality."Leading contact center suppliers continue to expand their hosted/cloud offerings, both directly and through channel partners, in order to reduce customer churn to pure-play hosted/cloud solution providers. Market majors, such as Avaya, Genesys, Verint, NICE, Cisco, Unify and SAP, are also successfully bridging the gap between multichannel customer contact and omnichannel customer care by collaborating with customers to extend services out to the greater enterprise."Businesses with unamortized and still-functional premises-based solutions will see the economic benefits in upgrading functionality on existing systems," noted Jamison. "Upgrading/replacing agent desktop and workforce optimization (WFO) applications will improve performance and CX."Growth Opportunities in the Global Contact Center Systems Market, Forecast to 2020, is part of Frost &amp; Sullivan's Customer Contact Growth Partnership Service program.About Frost &amp; SullivanFrost &amp; Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.
