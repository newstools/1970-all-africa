Two public primary schools in Bungoma have been issued with closure notices from public health officers over lack of toilets and dilapidated classrooms.Another school, Myanga Primary School, has been closed for a week now over the same reason.Bungoma County Public Health Director Moses Wambusi said the poor state of classes and toilets were posing a health danger to teachers and pupils."Over 1000 learners were using one pit latrine putting them in danger of acquiring serious diseases at Myanga."While at Netima the classrooms constructed nearly 60 years ago have cracks all over and the roofs can cave in anytime," Mr Wambusi said.Myanga Primary School board chairman Juma Akwata said it is unlikely that learners will sit for their examinations this term."We are struggling to build 12 new toilets so that the pupils can be recalled to sit for their end of term exams," Mr Akwata said.He blamed the local Constituency Development Fund (CDF) office for not providing funds to renovate the school.Netima Primary School head teacher Ferdinant Muchanga, echoing his comments saying his efforts to get assistance from Bumula CDF office have borne no fruit.He says four classes are in danger of falling anytime."We have over 1,000 pupils and the classes are overpopulated," he said.He appealed for assistance from the county and national government to construct new classes and desks.
