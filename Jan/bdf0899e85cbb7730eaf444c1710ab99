Linda Thomas-Greenfield, in her final address as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, focused on the future of U.S. relations with Africa. She spoke about the progress she has witnessed since she began her career in Liberia-where she was also ambassador from 2008 to 2012. She remarked on countries like Ghana and Nigeria, which emerged from military dictatorships to become vibrant democracies, as well as broader gains in economic growth, health outcomes, and education across the continent. She noted five key challenges for the continent: the youth bulge; economic growth; democratic governance; security; and ongoing humanitarian needs.
