The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has called for UN-backed commission against corruption and impunity to achieve President Muhammadu Buhari's anti-corruption agenda.SERAP, in a statement yesterday by its deputy director Timothy Adewale, said the acquittal of Senate President Bukola Saraki at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) of false assets declaration charges, suggested serious shortcomings in the criminal justice system.The organization urged, "Acting President Yemi Osinbajo to urgently and proactively pursue the establishment of a UN-backed International Commission Against Corruption and Impunity to assist our criminal justice system to effectively and efficiently investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases in the country, like it happened in Guatemala, for example."This government needs help in its fight against corruption, and strong leadership is now needed to urgently design a complementary and supportive plan."Adewale said SERAP believes the UN-backed commission would help to improve Nigeria's criminal justice system in the short, medium and long terms, so that it would better prosecute complex corruption cases.SERAP also urged the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to take over the prosecution Saraki by ensuring that the CCT decision was urgently appealed.
