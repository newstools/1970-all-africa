Rauf Aregbesola to speedily look into these issues and not play politics with his kinsmen.Ifabiyi also advised Kwara State government to look into the recent threat from Myetti Allah over the reprisal attack in Baruten local government council of the state where three herdsmen were killed in retaliation of the Baruba farmer who was killed after grazing in his farm.The OPC leader said that, it was high time the herdsmen place more value of human life than the life of their cattle."If they did not encroach into someone's farm, no one will challenge them, but rather than accept guilt, they turnout killing persons in a manner of oppressing the owners of the farm', he stressed.Ifabiyi opined that if the various tribes continue to behave in this manner, the unity of the country will continue to be threatened and the dream of one Nigeria might be a mirage.He called on the various governments and politicians to stand up to the occasion of defending their people rather than playing politics with precious lives.Ifabiyi used the medium to call on Nigerians to be watchful in choosing who will lead them by critically assessing those who had been on the side of the people as against money mongers who just seek their votes by giving them peanuts at election times.He however advised Nigerians to shun moneybag politicians and be up and doing towards electing the people that would bring new lease of life to the doorsteps of the populace.TAGSalertOodua Peoples Congress
