The suicide bomber was about making her way into the gathering at the wedding before the dog pounced on her.The girl, whose original mission appeared to have been thwarted, detonated her explosive while battling to wriggle herself from the canine grip of the dog. The gallant dog paid the supreme sacrifice as it died alongside the suicide bomber.Spokesperson of the Nigeria Police Force in Borno State, Victor Isuku, said the incident happened around 7:30a.m. in Belbelo community of Jere Local Council in Borno State."Information just received indicate that today (yesterday) around 0733hours (7.33am), a female suicide bomber with IED strapped to her body, attempted to infiltrate a wedding ceremony in Belbelo community of Jere LGA She was, however, prevented by a watchdog, so she had to detonate the IED to kill herself and the dog," said Isuku, a Deputy Superintendent of Police.Isuku said normalcy has since been restored in the area and "no further casualty was recorded apart from the dog."
