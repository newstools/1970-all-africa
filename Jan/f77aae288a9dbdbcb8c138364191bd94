It's been incredible being here.

He was duly voted through to the final by the public after Friday's semi-final performance.Daliso Chaponda's pivotal routine in the series which he was tipped to win after putting a great rib-cracking performance during semi-finals included the joke: "I'm black. Two hundred years ago, this would have been an auction", which elicited gasps as well as giggles.
